271,GROW model for Decision Management,"**GROW model for Decision Management

**During everyday work you may often face need to make strategic decisions. One of these decisions may be related to an issue with current process your team is using or a new project you‚Äôre starting. GROW technique was initially developed for coaching. However, I suggest you to try using it for making decisions when initiating projects.

The acronym GROW stands out for four stages: Goal, Reality, Options, Way Forward. This technique was developed at McKinsey and quickly adopted in the business world as it is simple and focuses on actions and outcomes. Most probably, you already use GROW but in the wrong order.

How to use GROW model:

**Establish a goal.** Make sure this is a SMART goal: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound. When defining your goal, answer the following questions:

1. What are the criteria of goal‚Äôs completion?
2. Does this goal fit into bigger perspective? Will it help you or your organization achieve current objectives?

**Examine current reality.** During this step try to understand all important features of the situation you are in right now. What are advantages and disadvantages at the moment? Did anyone face issues you can solve with this project?

**List your options.** Brainstorm all the ways you can achieve stated goal. Try not to compare them before you list as many as you can and then answer these questions:

1. Will this solution require new project or process?
2. Who will be involved?
3. What are the costs? How fast will you be able to implement this change?
4. What are the advantages and downsides of each solution?

**Decide on the way forward.** What solution will you be taking? Describe it is a project you will be implementing. List all stakeholders, set up a track and a timeline.

All these stages can be done during one meeting or split across several. I use GROW technique for creating small projects in my everyday work as it is less time-consuming compared to full-fletched Project Management techniques. I recommend you documenting the process of using GROW. If you will use slides slides, you may want to list main points in 4 slides or split a screen in 4 sections for each part.

Instead of doing Decision-Management with GROW, you can use the model to help team members improve performance, and to help them plan for and reach longer-term career objectives.

272,SMART technique for setting goals,"**SMART technique for setting goals**

During everyday work, you may often face the need to set goals. These goals are usually related to projects, processes or career changes. In most cases, you won‚Äôt be alone working on a goal. SMART technique can help you share goals with other people and deliver them in time.

The acronym SMART stands out for five characteristics: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.

How to set up SMART goals:

**State a specific result.** To do that, answer the following questions:
- What are the criteria of goal‚Äôs completion?
- What do you want to accomplish?
- What are the boundaries of this project?

**Make your goal measurable.** A measurable goal should answer the following questions:
- How can you measure success in absolute and relative numbers?
- How big are the changes or work required?

An example of a measurable goal would be: ‚ÄúTo increase direct sales of the Book by 30% by the end of the year.‚Äù

**Achievable.** Your goal must be realistic if you want to accomplish it. It should be difficult, but attainable. Achievable goal should answer the following questions:
- What resources will be needed to achieve this goal?
- Will you get support of your manager or colleagues?
- Have anyone achieved this goal before?

Do not set up goals on things you don‚Äôt control or influence. A goal of getting a promotion doesn‚Äôt depend much on you.

**Relevant.** Now you need to ensure that this goal is important to you, organization and your colleagues.
- Does this goal align with other goals?
- Is this goal worthwhile?
- What are the prerequisites for this goal? Are they fulfilled?
- Are you the right person to follow this goal?

**Time-bound.** Every goal needs a deadline which will mark a limited time you‚Äôll focus on this goal. Deadlines help you to prioritize everyday tasks and longer-term goals.
- When do I stop working on this goal?
- What will I do six months from now?
- What will I do in a month?
- What will I do today?

SMART is an effective tool that provides the clarity, focus and motivation you need to achieve your goals. It can also improve the overall ability to reach them by encouraging you to define your objectives and set a completion date. SMART goals are also easy to use by anyone, anywhere, without the need for specialist tools or training.

When practised, you‚Äôll apply SMART to all your goals and it‚Äôll take no longer than a minute for you to formulate a new goal.

273,Recommendations on engaging stakeholders,"**Recommendations on engaging stakeholders**

1. Communicate. Before trying to engage and influence stakeholders you have to understand the people you‚Äôll be working with. Sharing information with stakeholders is important, but it is equally important to first gather information about your stakeholders.

2. Consult early and often. A project may be unclear to stakeholders, especially in the early stages. Regular consultation is essential to ensure that requirements are agreed upon and a delivery solution is negotiated. You need to rely on the acceptance of the majority of stakeholders when making any decisions about the project.

3. They‚Äôre only human. Stakeholders don‚Äôt always behave in a rational, consistent or predictable way. Try to understand the root cause of stakeholder‚Äôs behaviour to maintain a productive relationship.

4. Plan stakeholder engagement. A consistent and measured approach to stakeholder engagement is essential. 

5. Build relationships. A relationship with stakeholder results in increased trust. This trust allows people to work together more easily and effectively. Identify relationships between stakeholders and build your own to increase confidence in the project environment and speed problem solving and decision-making.

6. Don‚Äôt overdo it. Use your foresight to anticipate hazards, take simple and timely actions with stakeholders. Don‚Äôt make a chore out of stakeholder management for you or anyone else.

7. Be aware of risks. Stakeholders are both important and influential, thus they may bring risks to the project. The more stakeholder is engaged in a project ‚Äì the bigger are the risks. Treat stakeholders as potential sources of both risks and opportunities within the project.

8. Compromise. Establish the most acceptable baseline across stakeholders‚Äô expectations and priorities. Always remember the relative importance of every stakeholder and stick to a weighted hierarchy when deciding on the project requirements.

9. Facilitate the definition of success. Project success can mean a thousand different things. It‚Äôs your role to establish a definition of project success shared by the project‚Äôs stakeholders.

10. Take responsibility. Stakeholder engagement is the responsibility of every member of the team. Good project governance requires providing clarity about stakeholder engagement roles and responsibilities and what is expected of people involved in the project.

The project manager leads the project team to meet the project‚Äôs objectives and stakeholders‚Äô expectations. It is in Project Manager‚Äôs responsibility to manage constraints and balance competing project constraints influence with the available resources.

We will discuss types of Project Constraints, ways to identify and document them and, finally, how they influence projects.

Do you want to make a career in FinTech? Or do you already work there? Then you‚Äôll need to know the latest FinTech trends.
 
I have worked as a Business Analyst in Banking for over a year. Here is the list of Fintech trends I find the most important.

FinTech refers to software, mobile applications, and other technologies created to improve and automate traditional forms of finance for businesses and consumers alike. FinTech includes everything from straightforward mobile payment apps to complex blockchain networks housing encrypted transactions.

Fintech started its roots in the 50s when banks introduced early credit cards that eliminated the need for consumers to carry physical currency in their day-to-day lives. This fintech revolution has led to the mobile payment apps, blockchain networks, and social media-housed payment options we regularly use today.

**1. Digital banking continues to grow.** Digital banking means delivering banking services over the internet: either online banking via Web or mobile banking. Many consumers already manage their money, request and pay loans, and purchase insurance through digital-first banks. FDIC reported that 34% of Americans used mobile banking as their primary way of accessing their accounts in 2019. The digital banking market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% by 2026.

**2. Blockchain technology** allows for decentralized transactions without involving a government or other third-party. Blockchain technology has been developing for years, and 2022 is likely to continue this trend as more industries turn to advanced data encryption. Smart Contracts and Tokens play a role.

**3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies** have changed how fintech companies scale and redefined the services they offer to clients. AI and ML can reduce operational costs, increase the value provided to clients, and detect fraud. These technologies become more affordable and accessible and will play a major role in fintech‚Äôs continued evolution ‚Äî especially as more brick-and-mortar banks go digital.

**4. Fintech regulation** will intensify because of the blockchain. Countries will be nervous about financial breaches. Another topic that regulators would scrutinize closely is the question of data ownership. The ideal outcome is a set of international standards comprehensive enough to calm the nerves of businesses and consumers alike.
 
**5. Mobile transactions.** Services like Google and Apple Pay will replace plastic credit and debit cards with a single application. These services make e-commerce payments fast and easy as we pay with Google Pay cards with a single click. It can both allow for more State control of banks (MIR in Russia) and monopolization of the market between a few big digital banks.

Fintech promises huge to nations, companies and individual consumers allowing for customization and inclusivity of financial services.",21/03/2022,1647864021000.0,True,True,0,1647864021000.0,1648468806000.0
316,[‚Äã‚Äã](https://telegra.ph/file/cdfe1f32cbb4fd9dd87c7.jpg)üìö The Principles of Argumentation,"[‚Äã‚Äã](https://telegra.ph/file/cdfe1f32cbb4fd9dd87c7.jpg)**üìö The Principles of Argumentation**

Working in Industry, especially with Analytics, we have to prove certain points and ideas to our managers, colleagues and requestors. Every Data Analyst knows the benefits of data-driven decision making. But how do you make indirect conclusions backed up by logic?

I work as a Business Analyst in Banking and I prove ideas every day. Here‚Äôs my simplified take on Argumentation for Business needs.

There are four modes of discourse: narration, description, exposition, and argumentation. Of the four, argumentation is the primal form of communication and involves the fine art of persuasion as well.

Principles of Argumentation for argumentative writing are often taught in classical universities. But I believe that every CS and Analytics specialist has to apply them too to boost their Soft Skills.

**1. The Proposition** - the major premise of the argument. You‚Äôll need at least 3 major claims to prove it.

**2. Evidence.** There are 2 types of evidence: facts and opinions. There are 4 categories of facts: by scientific measurement (temperature, pressure, Richter Scale for earthquakes), by the Way Nature Works, by Observation, by Statistics.

Opinions are basically expert opinions expressed by an established authority in the field.  Use examples and illustrations to bring your proposition to further convince the audience.

**3. Fallacious Reasoning** - illogical reasoning. Avoid these mistakes: hasty generalizations (insufficient data or too few examples), begging the Questions (assume something that needs to be proven as a basis), evading the Question (move from the real issue to another topic), argumentum ad hominem (direct argument to the prejudices and instincts other than real arguments).

**4. Discussion.** There are four standards of judgment: Convention of Bilaterality (at least two competing messages), Convention of Self-Risk (you risk being proven wrong), the Fairness Doctrine (debate has to be extended to guarantee that all viewpoints are considered), Commitment to Rationality (everyone has the right to use logic to debate and argue).

If you adhere to these principles, your argumentation will become undeniable and your argumentative work will be a lot more professional and deep. People like professional speakers and conversationalists. And Soft Skills become more and more valued by employers every day.",28/03/2022,1648468806000.0,True,True,0,1648468806000.0,1649088005000.0

Project Management is becoming an important skill for non-PMs as companies transition their models from Processes to Projects.

I work as a Business Analyst in Banking and here‚Äôs my curated list of great PM courses.

#ProjectManagement

I believe that every research we do is a project. You can't optimize the research itself with PM techniques. But you can definitely optimize the way you engage with colleagues be it Requirements Elicitation, Stakeholder Engagement, or Project Closure.

1. PMI (pmi .org) has 3 free courses on Project Management you can take online?

One of these courses was my first experience with Project Management and it was a great start.

Even though a course was a bit detached it will give you a basic understanding of the most important concepts and rules from which you can build.

You can enroll at pmi .org with your account for free.

But there are many other free courses worth taking.




2. HSC (oxfordhomestudy .com) offers courses:
Project Management
Six Sigma.

3. On Udemy .com there are courses:

Project Management Templates Creation Course
Project Management: Manage Projects like a Professional
Project Management for Non-Project Managers.

4. At Edx .org I‚Äôd recommend courses:

Introduction to Project Management taught by the University of Adelaide
Applied Scrum for Agile Project Management from the University of Maryland.

5. At Coursera .org there are courses:

Project Management: The Basics for Success by the University of California
Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management by the University of Virginia.

Once you acquire basic understanding of Project Management, you can dive deeper on tools and techniques Project Managers use.
Those can be Scrum/Agile, Waterwall planning, Stakeholder management techniques, etc. depending on the way you and your team work.

Often different teams in an organization each try to gather work-related information on their own. It‚Äôs duplicate work.

I'm a Business Analyst in Banking and here's my take on methods of sharing knowledge with other teams.

The importance of soft skills for IT specialists is highly debated. You may be a wonderful Data Analyst, Product Manager, or IT Project Manager, but without writing skills your career opportunities are limited. üßµ

Writing is required both for remote and on-site employees. Every meeting you don‚Äôt schedule is an extra cup of coffee. Effective written communication gives you exactly that.

Great writing addresses the problems and concerns of specific readers. It‚Äôs your job to enable collaboration by effective communication with team members, stakeholders, or end-users. Depending on the reader you may delve into details or provide a big picture. 

You can empower decision-making by delivering factual information in the right form and at the right time.

Depending on the form of writing, you need to stick to various styles. E-mail, Project documentation, Blog post, and Knowledge texts have different requirements. 

You may use more charts & diagrams or stick to plain essay-like text, stick to facts or provide an opinion, establish stability or enable debate.

Another important aspect of writing is [Argumentation](https://sneakbug8.com/principles-of-argumentation/). Universities teach Logic only to Classic or Humanities students. As a result, IT specialists often lack skills for argumentative writing.

To boost your logical skills, check out a free book [A Guide to Good Reasoning](https://publishing.lib.umn.edu/publication/a-guide-to-good-reasoning/) from the University of Minnesota.

If you aren‚Äôt a native English speaker just like me, I‚Äôd recommend you deepen your Business English and Technical English. Test your level at [Cambridge](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/test-your-english/business/) online first. Then you can start with a [Free Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/business-english-essential-vocabulary/). 

Continue your education with free [Harvard online courses](https://pll.harvard.edu/subject/business/free). If you want more practical examples check out talkenglish.com.

325,[‚Äã‚Äã](https://telegra.ph/file/d4948ccecd4cdcb833679.jpg)7 tips for your first IT job interview,"[‚Äã‚Äã](https://telegra.ph/file/d4948ccecd4cdcb833679.jpg)**7 tips for your first IT job interview**

You may find a lot of job interview tips on the Internet, but they mostly focus on the way companies and job postings are built, not how you sell yourself. It‚Äôs wrong.

I found my first and current job at Citi last July. Since then, a lot of my student friends from universities got hired too. Here is our collective experience on how to prepare for your first IT interview to land the job of your dreams.

**1. Learn types of Interview questions.** The usual ones are Credibility, Opinion, Behavioral, Competency, and Role Play questions. Write down questions that get asked the most and prepare answers to them. Good answers are the backbone of any interview.

**2. Tell your story.** The less the interviewer has to ask you the easier you‚Äôll pass. If you can touch on all the points the interviewer got to check in your personal story, you‚Äôll have an offer in no time. Tell about your projects and what were the biggest obstacles, why you want to work in this company or field, what are your ambitions and what do you do to fulfill them. 

**3. Have questions to ask.** You may not believe you get to choose the company you‚Äôll work at, but you have to understand that interviewers want applicants to ask questions. That‚Äôs an indicator of your interest. And all managers want to hire interested & motivated people.

**4. Use your soft skills to the fullest extent.** Soft Skills matter even for beginner-level jobs. In the biggest corporations, employees use a lot of internally made software you can‚Äôt know. Starting from extensions to Outlook and ending with internal Social Networks, this software is unique to the company. But you can have the skills to learn it fast. And that‚Äôs one application of soft skills.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the difference between an Analyst with great communication skills and little SQL knowledge and a lone wolf with deep knowledge of the PostgreSQL engine. Startups may hire the latter, but corporations will prefer the former.

**5. Sell your Unique Skill Set.** Investigate the way you differ from other candidates and build a strong presence out of that. Do you know how to write great documentation? Do you use the most complicated features of Excel? Do you effectively sell your data findings to customers? Communicate these things to the interviewer explicitly and be ready to prove them.

**6. Stick to a plan.** Once you find the skills you have to communicate, write them down and learn by heart. You‚Äôll need to find a way to insert them into the conversation. After all, an interview is a conversation. If you can‚Äôt say anything useful to the questions the interviewer has prepared, why won‚Äôt you change the flow of the interview to expose the best of you? It‚Äôs risky but still worth it.

**7. Evade automatic interviews.** Some companies use automated Interview systems that ask you to answer a certain question in a camera in 3 minutes. I‚Äôd suggest you avoid them for several reasons. Firstly, such interviews suit people with really developed hard skills but lack soft skills like top universities graduates with a portfolio of hackathons. Most likely, you have no way to compete in hard skills. A company can interview a hundred candidates for one position with such a system. And you don‚Äôt want to gamble a 1% chance. Secondly, you won‚Äôt get an offer anytime soon. In two cases of automatic interviews I had, I got an answer from the company in 3 weeks! I work in a company that offered me a job an hour after the interview. I had two paychecks, less competition, no stress & better career opportunities just because I didn‚Äôt wait for the call.

After all, you should tailor your CV and resume for each company you apply to. But you should also tailor your story and presence to be the best employee a company can buy for its buck. You are not a Developer or an Analyst. You‚Äôre a problem-solver and a critical thinker with a specific set of hard skills. Companies pay exactly for that.",25/04/2022,1650900600000.0,True,True,0,1650900600000.0,1651414610000.0

**A year of remote work brought the importance of effective business writing to the next level. With these skills you save a lot of time and effort both offline and online.

Tips in this post are based both on business literature and my observations. Depending on the premise you may employ different formats of text. For now, let‚Äôs imagine you want to start a project to increase customer sales.

**1. Start with an idea.** Every text you write has a message you‚Äôre trying to deliver. If you write it explicitly, clearly, and concisely, there‚Äôs little chance someone will misinterpret your goals.

**2. Write for a person.** There‚Äôs a clear group of people who will read your text and make decisions. Think about these readers. Write your text in a way it‚Äôs easy to read, not easy to write.

**3. Back with data.** Data-driven decision making is a must nowadays. Your ideas have to be backed by numbers or evidence.

**4. Give examples and not just adjectives.** Describe the concrete actions you will take to achieve your goals. Don‚Äôt make it ‚Äútime-efficient‚Äù deliver a plan draft.

**5. Avoid jargon.** Often your reader will be from another team or department. They may have a different set of jargon they use. Make sure you‚Äôre on the same page with your terms.

**6. Do not misrepresent reality.** Write with integrity. All facts stated should be true at the moment you‚Äôre writing

**7. Leverage your communication skills.** Ensure that the document is error-free - no spelling or grammatical mistakes. Always proofread your emails.

**8. Follow up.** Remember, we all have huge To-Do lists. It‚Äôs in your interest to follow up with colleagues who forgot to ask you. Make it, for example, an email every three business days.

Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll change the easy way to write you‚Äôre used to immediately. I suggest you write these tips on a post-it note and stick it near the work desk.

I bet every one of you has ever asked the question ‚ÄúWhy does this meeting take so long?‚Äù Meetings are exhausting. It was a problem before the pandemic, it has become an even bigger problem for remote meetings. You would never want important customers or stakeholders to feel the meeting was a waste of time.

Running meetings right can result in better decision-making and increased innovation, cohesion, agility, and resilience. They are essential to thrive in competitive markets in the time of the pandemic.

In this article, I‚Äôll share research-based insights and tips on how to make your meetings more effective, well-used and engaging.

**1. Stick to one meeting type.** According to Seth Godin, there are three kinds of meetings:

a. Information: a meeting in which the participants are informed about something.

b. Discussion: a meeting which aims to give input or direction, or to receive feedback.

c. Permission: a meeting in which one side proposes something, in the hope that the other approves it.

Often participants of the same meeting don‚Äôt align with their goals for the meeting. It causes misunderstanding and time waste.

**2. Limit meeting time.** Parkinson‚Äôs Law states that Work expands to fill the time available for its completion (and not according to how complex it is). It makes perfect sense to limit the time of meetings. The standard time slot for a meeting is 30 minutes. It allows participants to discuss a topic or two, but not waste time going off-topic. I‚Äôd recommend you never run a meeting much longer than it was planned for even if other participants can stay for longer.

**3. The question rule.** There are three types of questions asked in a meeting:

1. Comprehension questions
2. Questions to support the process (e.g. to ensure everyone understands what you are talking about),
3. Debate questions (that present a challenge).

All three types are legitimate, but they should come in the exact order to achieve the maximum benefit of the conversation.

**4. Share agenda preemptively.** The best thing you can do to run an effective meeting - is not to run one. If your problem can be resolved async via email - you should do it. The agenda for the meeting allows your colleagues to prepare for the meeting and to give you an answer in an async manner. Why spend half an hour on the phone if there were no questions after a written inquiry.

**5. Inform your colleagues if you expect them to do something in the meeting.** If you plan a meeting to get a sample of customers' information because you don‚Äôt have the right access - communicate it explicitly. There‚Äôs nothing worse than coming to a call where no one can help you because they don‚Äôt have the access either.

**Choose the right participants.** There‚Äôs little value to inviting people who aren‚Äôt directly related to the conversation. If you are unsure whether person X can help you with subject Y, I suggest you describe the expected roles & responsibilities for the participants. Remote meetings plummet in quality as size increases.

If you are unsure how you can help a meeting organized by someone else - ask for an explanation. You can save both yourself and your colleagues time with the right question.

Being a manager or Team Leader, you will inevitably meet working with the team‚Äôs processes and knowledge. Techniques such as Scrum, Agile, and Kanban can help you with processes, and knowledge management software like Confluence can help you simplify Knowledge Management

 As Team knowledge often complements Teams‚Äô processes, a problem arises: how to split information about a real set of actions a team member executes into formal Processes and informal Team knowledge.

One point of view is that any information lacking which presents risks to the process objectives is process-related information and must be included in the procedure.

A risk is the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. Therefore, the lack of any related information presents a risk. Can you hope to include any possible team knowledge in the procedure? No. There must be a dividing line.

Here are 5 tips that will help you understand how to work with process-related information and team knowledge:

**1. When is it time to create a process from the project‚Äôs steps?**

As soon as you have performed the same steps twice in different projects, it is time to document them as a process. Then new projects will employ existing processes to deliver objectives quickly and in an organized manner. Don‚Äôt make the Project Manager reinvent the wheel.

**2. What information should I save in the Knowledge Base?**

You should save any information related to the current or future inventory of the team. If you use the Git repository to version control code and find out a storage limit is 10GB ‚Äì write it down somewhere.

**3. How to distinguish information about a process from the team‚Äôs knowledge?**

A process describes actions a specialist takes to achieve a result. For example, if his goal were to schedule a new script, then a process would be the upload of the script to a remote server and scheduling it using dedicated software.

Information on the way a system works is **NOT** a subject to process. Its place is in the Knowledge Base, not in Policy or Procedure. Don‚Äôt update teams‚Äô procedures each time a system is modified as long as the workflow stays the same.

**4. How can I provide additional information about the system‚Äôs peculiarities to the person executing the process?**

In this case, I‚Äôd recommend you make an extended version of a process stored in a team‚Äôs Playbook. When writing such a Playbook, follow these Rules:

1. To be useful, Playbook should have all the details to eliminate the practical need to read a procedure when executing the process.

2. To be trustworthy, Playbook must always comply with active policies and procedures and be updated as soon as source processes change. 

**5. When do I stop improving already documented processes?**

The short answer is ‚Äì never. Long answer ‚Äì it depends. As you know, Process Management is an incremental process that includes continual improvement of processes as long as you use them. As soon as the process fulfils the needs of team members and external stakeholders (such as Controls), you can stop improving it. Nonetheless, there will be a time when the process will stop being 100% correct then you will have to update it once again. 

Both Process Management and Knowledge Management are inevitable parts of everyday work for managers and Team Leaders. You can optimize it, but you should never get rid of them. Every recently promoted manager or Team Lead must understand the difference between Process Management and Knowledge Management to make the work of his reports more effective.",07/06/2022,1654615800000.0,True,True,0,1654615800000.0,1655134200000.0

Good presentation on a performance review is vital for your career advancement, getting realistic feedback from the manager, and increasing collaboration with your colleagues backed by increased authority and respect.

According to UC Berkeley‚Äôs Guide to Managing Human Resources, ‚ÄúPerformance Management is an ongoing process of communication between a supervisor and an employee that occurs throughout the year, in support of accomplishing the strategic objectives of the organization."" It ‚Äúincludes clarifying expectations, setting objectives, identifying goals, providing feedback, and reviewing results.‚Äù

Before managers sit down for the Performance Appraisal process, they will ideally have already been participating in ongoing communication with their employees.

If you are prepared to make the most of this sit-down, it‚Äôll be a painless process and might even be eye-opening and super insightful.

At a minimum, you should bring a list of accomplishments and a catalog of questions. Think of how you can self-promote, but be prepared to respond to your manager‚Äôs feedback.

What else can you do to improve your presentation during performance evaluation?

We often rush doing tasks that we just received. It can lead to us spending time on tasks that will be of no use to anyone. Imagine finishing a report just to find out that the requestor has already received the same information from another source. Such a task can be discovered to violate your team‚Äôs policies or current priorities and goals. Patience is a great virtue when working in a modern business environment.

You can‚Äôt simply take more and more tasks forever. You have to make the most of your working time, so get rid of work you don‚Äôt intend to do. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù early helps both you and the Requestors. Prioritization should be done in a smart way to avoid scrutiny for skipping great projects. Remember, busyness doesn‚Äôt equal progress.

So, what can you do to prioritize tasks effectively?

**1. Evaluate long-term goals.** Write down the goals and current priorities of the organization, your team, and yourself. Make it a single list you‚Äôll use to evaluate the importance of new tasks. Big picture is vital in prioritizing effectively.
**2. Gather a full scope of tasks and their deadlines.** If a task doesn‚Äôt have a formal deadline ‚Äì assign one yourself. Filter out the tasks not aligned with objectives from the list you gathered. Filling your day with tasks that have no impact on goals is wasted time.
Consider effort. Sort tasks based on the estimated time and effort required to finish them. **3. Collect data from similar tasks to improve your estimates.** Mark groups of tasks that can be done simultaneously and don‚Äôt depend on your colleagues.
**4. Avoid competing priorities.** Most Important Tasks methodology (MIT) involves creating a separate list of just three tasks that must be done that day. Stay focused and do not react to concurrent tasks or ad-hoc requests. Multitasking has been linked to a decline in performance.

You have finite time for work. It‚Äôs important to be realistic in setting goals and prioritizing tasks. Don‚Äôt create false expectations of those around you.

**No book is going to have the perfect advice for each situation first-time managers face. Being a good manager is making good decisions with information on hand and following several guidelines that differ very bad managers from okay ones. In this post I‚Äôve listed the 8 that I think is the most important:

**1. Success of team members is your success.** Don‚Äôt prevent anyone from growing in hopes to keep them on your team. Such behavior only irritates employees and causes them to leave even if they never planned it. After all, what would you do without your reports?
**2. Build leaders within.** Have leaders within a team manage projects or subgroups on their own. It‚Äôll save you a ton of time and you‚Äôll be able to focus on the more important stuff.
**3. Use caution when promising rewards.** Rewards shouldn‚Äôt replace real motivation. If the only thing keeping your team moving forward is rewards, the moment you take the rewards away your team stops. Reward them for great work, hard work, team accomplishments, and meeting goals. Don‚Äôt use rewards as a carrot on a stick just to get them to show up to work each day.
**4. Be goal-focused.** Create a clear set of short-term and long-term goals for the team. Help your team to set up personal goals tailored to them and aligned with the team goals simultaneously.
**5. Balance team goals with organizational goals.** A part of your job is to protect your domain from any outside storms like crunches or impossible requests. Making your team everyday work to become hell on Earth to earn a little more profit for the company is an easy way to lose the best employees.
**6. Encourage innovation.** Make it safe to be creative and help the team to brainstorm to find out-of-the-box solutions. Innovation both generates profits for the company and motivates your best employees.
**7. Don‚Äôt let the team accumulate debt both technological and procedural.** Delivering a new project without properly finishing the previous one is walking on thin ice. Eventually, you‚Äôll have to face all the mess of the inventory you left behind to fix some issues or to build new projects on top and it‚Äôll take 10x longer to understand what you were thinking at that time.
**8. Set up guiding principles and policies.** To avoid being called for favoritism, document the good and the bad and be fair to everyone.

First-time managers, don‚Äôt rush for books or Google when facing a challenge but gather information, think, and make decisions.

**As my latest article with tips for first-time managers has received much positive feedback on Telegram, I‚Äôve decided to play with this topic a little more. Let‚Äôs talk about facilitating coordination and cooperation within a team.

Cooperation is a must-have aspect of effective teams. Promoting cooperation is one of the most important manager‚Äôs responsibilities. You cannot simply order someone to cooperate with another person. 

Tools for promoting cooperation are split between procedural and interpersonal.

**Procedural means** stand for developing team processes in a way that defends both parties of cooperation, allows shared achievements, and gives teammates flexibility in self-organization and organizing their workload around projects and tasks. 

Directs will then actually decide to cooperate to reduce their responsibility and optimize workload all by themselves.

**Interpersonal means** consist of helping directs to understand the benefits of cooperation, running meetings, suggesting best practices for cooperation, and allowing sporadic change of Project and Task owners as long as they are under someone‚Äôs control.",11/07/2022,1657553400000.0,False,False,0,1657553400000.0,1657553401000.0
337,Now let‚Äôs talk about the main issues with cooperation & tools you may employ to resolve them.,"Now let‚Äôs talk about the main issues with cooperation & tools you may employ to resolve them.

**Make connections between coworkers. **Teammates tend to create their networks of usual contacts. Often, they won‚Äôt even think of reaching someone outside the circle of 3 to 10 colleagues they‚Äôre used to working with. Such structure slows down the spread of ideas and best practices slow down the team altogether. I recommend you to create a set of touchpoints (mostly meetings) where everyone would discuss a certain sphere of knowledge (like SQL, Tableau, CRM, etc.) helping colleagues to develop a broader connection network with experts on various subjects. These meetings should be a safe space for sharing ideas and promoting a learning and teaching culture.

**Develop leaders within.** Collaboration is usually centered around a small number of activists and informal leaders. If there are no such people, the manager is responsible for answering the questions and helping with everyday issues. And if you‚Äôre too busy to do that there‚Äôll likely be no cooperation. Find and nurture informal leaders within a team by letting them manage projects and subgroups on their own.

Working collaboratively is not a skill that everyone is born with; however, it is a skill that one can learn which is why organizations spend money investing in the employees‚Äô teamwork skills.

**Celebrate wins collectively.** Teams who win together work together, and vice versa. Celebrating personal and professional triumphs together establishes a sense of common purpose and collective victory, and makes teams more inclined to work together towards shared success. These celebrations can take the form of announcing accomplishments in meetings and giving a round of applause or planning a party or outing to commemorate meeting a goal. Sharing joy creates a sense of camaraderie and encourages team members to look out for each other‚Äôs interests.

**Clarify roles and responsibilities, and set up expectations.** Understanding individual roles and responsibilities is essential for teamwork. At the start of the project or during team formation, communicate clear instructions on how the work is divided and what expectations are for each contributor.

It is also imperative that the leadership sets clear expectations for the teams so that as employees work together, everyone is clear on which goal or objective they should reach.

I believe that knowledge workers aren‚Äôt people naturally inclined to cooperate as we do most tasks alone combining them afterward. It‚Äôs different from working on one construction site or conveyor belt together. Teams need help getting along and getting tasks accomplished. Even the most in-sync teams sometimes need to get back to basics and receive a refresher on working together.

**Genuine problem solving often requires us to ask people for help and information. This is applicable for both work projects and career advancement as a whole. Creating strong cases for your requests will improve the chances you get positive answers and prevent miscommunication of excepted results.

Often, inner thoughts dissuade us from asking for anything. It is hard to overcome them. These thoughts never go away even if we are super experienced and capable. They will always be there in our heads to try to keep us ‚Äúsafe and comfortable.‚Äù We have to ask for what we want despite these thoughts.

There is an art to the ask. It cannot be an ultimatum. It cannot be just about you and why you need it. Here are five tips on how you can ask for what you want and feel good about it.

**Tip 1: Provide context. **Try to add background information to the problem and ease the listener into it. What are you trying to achieve? Why do you think it‚Äôs important? What will it take to make your request a reality?

**Tip 2: Be clear and specific. **A clear and specific question sounds like a solution and not a problem. For example, ‚ÄúI want to work more remotely.‚Äù is NOT a good example. It‚Äôs too vague and leaves the listener with the problem of having to guess what you mean. Instead, say ‚ÄúI would like to work remotely 100% of the time and only come into the office as needed to save commute time.‚Äù

**Tip 3: Always explain why your request is good for the company as well as you.** Explain all your reasons why you should get what you are asking. If you are not convinced by your own rationale then you cannot convince others either. This benefit should usually come in the form of Business Value or Compliance.
Never make the person that you are asking the bad guy. It is better not to make anyone guilty at all.

**Tip 4: Be detached from the outcome.** It‚Äôs important to make your ask regardless of the answer you‚Äôll get. This will build your confidence and build your skills in making the request. Everyone gets more ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on the first try than ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Now that you planted the seed of what you want, you have to give it time to grow.

**Tip 5: Be persistent. **Getting what you want usually takes more than one conversation and a bit of time. If at first, you get a no, ask what would make it into a yes. That will give you some clues on what you can work on. Once you have worked on it, you can make the question again. Also, keep thinking about why what you are asking is good for your manager and the company. Make sure you are clear in articulating that each time you ask.

Doing all the above doesn‚Äôt guarantee you will get a yes to your request. But, if you don‚Äôt step up to the plate and take your swing, you will never get a hit. That‚Äôs guaranteed!",18/07/2022,1658158200000.0,True,True,0,1658158200000.0,1658763000000.0

**Previously we have discussed two topics especially important to first-time managers: how to drive your team to success and how to promote cooperation. And as everyone knows that micromanagement is bad, I've decided to continue this sequence with my take on situations when a manager should micromanage his team.

According to the definition in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, micromanaging bosses ‚Äútry to control or manage all the small parts of something (such as an activity) in a way that is usually not wanted or that causes problems.‚Äù

Even though micromanagement is usually portrayed negatively, there are quite a few exceptional situations where micromanagement might be the best solution to deal with a difficult problem or help the team meet its goals. Here are some situations where micromanaging might be especially needed or welcome, according to leadership experts:

**1. In a time of crisis. **This crisis can be both internal and external to the organization. In times of great turbulence due to recession or a company changing strategy you should employ more directed attention to the processes happening in your team. At the same time, you‚Äôll report to your manager more often and be requested for more detailed explanations. After all, you‚Äôre responsible for the mistakes and failures of your subordinates. ‚ÄúAn all-hands-on-deck mentality for a new endeavor also may convey a team approach for getting something launched,‚Äù writes Christine M. Riordan, an author and expert on leadership, in a 2010 Forbes article.

**2. When the team has many new employees. **New employees never know the processes and caveats of their execution. You may think newbies will ask you in case of a doubt, but that usually doesn‚Äôt happen due to many reasons of human psychology. By letting newer members wander unattended you risk entirely missing big parts of the project even with the best Procedures and Guides available. Whereas, more experienced teams work better without much supervision from their managers. It is important to establish upfront that close supervision and review are expected to lessen as time goes on and people figure out what they are doing.

**3. When rebuilding processes. **As a manager, you can‚Äôt directly experience the business processes your subordinates follow. Understanding the way things are done is crucial to process optimization. The best way you can get that knowledge as a manager is by micromanaging affected teams for a couple of weeks, making observations and taking notes in the process. Don‚Äôt forget to inform your colleagues beforehand.

**4. When working in a highly sensitive area.** There are teams and organizations where you will always have to micromanage due to substantial risks even the smallest issue brings. These could be Legal departments, Banking or Defense-related industries, or simple PII data.

**5. When facing customer complaints or results are disappointing.** Both situations require investigation, as well as action items to resolve the situation. What is being done to turn things around? Don‚Äôt let unfinished jobs linger. Again, you don‚Äôt want to nag or belittle your employees, but you do want to take an active role in trying to investigate and resolve the problem. The most effective managers are constant communicators according to a 2010 Towers Watson Global Workforce Study.

Some well-known executives pride themselves on their ability to delve into detailed matters and handle problems, which essentially micromanagement is. ‚ÄúLeaders today need to demonstrate many leadership styles, depending on the situation, and have the agility and ability to move into a style that is not naturally their own‚Äù.

Choosing the extent of control, you want to have over your team is a challenging decision every manager has to make. While this choice is never final, due to many various factors involved, you should consult experienced managers of your organization prematurely.",25/07/2022,1658763000000.0,True,True,0,1658763000000.0,1660635000000.0

** 
Innovation is a cornerstone for modern Businesses as even the smallest performance gain can separate a profitable company from a bankrupt one. CEOs, experienced managers, and business gurus all talk about innovation. As a first-time manager, you play a vital role in the innovation process.

Apply these tips to help your team innovate:
**1. Promote cooperation and collaboration in the team.** No innovation is created, documented, and integrated by a single person. Best ideas come when several people work together and combine their knowledge and skills to find a point for improvement. I wrote a guide on promoting cooperation.

**2. Optimize Business Processes together. **Some may think the manager is solely responsible for the development and improvement of Business Processes. They are wrong. Indeed, Process Management doesn't happen without a manager's involvement. However, team members are to be included in the process too. After all, they are the people who'll follow the steps of the Procedure.

**3. Facilitate cross-team bonds and communication.** Often, innovative ideas come from unexpected places such as an accountant looking at the building plan. It's a rare innovation that impacts a single team or department. Usually, productive change requires the involvement of dozens of teams supporting a single product or a service in the Organization.

**4. Collect feedback and adopt it. **Innovation usually comes in a row of small observations and incremental changes. This process usually comes in 4 steps: Design, Build, Run, and Analyze. Bureaucracy stifles innovation. This cycle of optimizations and improvements can happen a thousand times in big projects.

**5. Stop thinking about innovation for a moment.** There's no point in improving the process no one uses because everyone is innovating process upgrades. Does no one have any ideas? Relax, work as usual, and check again in a week.

It's impossible to forcefully create an innovation. Continuous development of innovations requires good Team Members, optimal Business Processes, and innovation-promoting Corporate Culture. All of which are, at least partially, controlled by the middle managers.",16/08/2022,1660635000000.0,True,True,0,1660635000000.0,1661268600000.0

I believe there are two ways one can advance his career: either becoming a highly qualified specialist or providing general utility to the team and organization. The first ones often become seniors - senior engineers/programmers/lawyers. The second usually becomes managers: middle managers, Project Managers, Process Managers, etc. Governing other people requires less hard skills and more communication, discipline, and leadership - all being Soft Skills.

Here's the way you can advance your career with Soft Skills ignoring Hard Skills entirely:

 1. Focus on consulting your colleagues & solving organizational, processual, and project-related questions instead of executing the work itself.
 2. Be ready to develop your career in management. Work on your management skills, be it Process Management, Process Management, or Budgeting.
 3. Be proactive and communicate a lot. Your success entirely depends on this. You don't want a hiring manager to decide between you and another candidate. You want him to hire you immediately as you lack the Hard Skills to compete directly.
 4. Develop a portfolio. Every knowledge worker should maintain a portfolio. However, you hope to skip the tech interview entirely because of your previous experience and great self-presentation.
 5. Act like a manager when allowed. Take responsibility for projects and processes, develop a contacts network, and communicate with other teams directly instead of relying on your manager. Your manager will appreciate that in a couple of weeks due to reduced workload and pressure.

Remember, you need Hard Skills to get your first job. Noone becomes a manager immediately after graduation. However, you can expect to stop developing Hard Skills once you establish yourself as a regular specialist in your field.

Project documentation is often a deciding factor separating successful projects from unsuccessful ones. Every project with insufficient documentation is a gamble posing risk to the organization. Every requirement missing from the documentation can be viewed differently by stakeholders. Every decision made during the execution can be redone for no reason causing ineffectiveness.

Project documentation is meant to facilitate project success without becoming a burden or a job in itself.
We won't be discussing how to format the text or what software to use, but the general principles of documenting big enough projects to have multiple dimensions and sets of documents related to them.

Usually, confusion in project documentation is caused by these factors: poor planning, inadequate communication, or substandard organization.

**1. Organize documentation in one centralized storage with the latest approved versions of each document. **It'll save the project team a lot of time sharing the documents via mail. Align information spread thin across multiple channels in a single storage.
**2. Divide information between documents on a basis of project dimensions. **Don't mix technical requirements with the Business process. This separation of duties will allow various involved actors to work with their own domain of expertise whilst contributing to the project.
**3. Ensure documents don't conflict and set up priorities between documents. **The only thing worse than missing information is conflicting information. Set up a framework of documents priorities over each other at the start of the project to prevent conflicts.
**4. Don't duplicate information in several places or carefully rewrite it to the context. **This will help you with avoiding conflicts. But the main goal is to provide each party with the most accurate information intended for their use. There's no need to include SQL table mapping in the call operator's handbook.
**5. Embed discussion in documents. **There's no need to use email if a teammate has comments about a specific place of documentation. Most modern editors allow you to include comments inline or separately.
**6. Notify all interested parties of documentation updates. **Try to balance between providing useful notifications and spamming teammates about documents presenting no interest to them. Systems like Confluence allow subscribing to changes on specific pages.

**On a project, each stakeholder and project team member has a specific view of what's going on. They differ in understanding what steps the team will perform, how long they will take, and what the results will be. Managing expectations is about establishing a common denominator that aligns with Project documentation and plans.

As a Project Manager, you should manage expectations to establish healthy relationships with colleagues, reduce confusion, empower yourself with concrete structure, enhance communication, and create accountability.

What can you do for proper expectation management?

**A) Share accurate information and plans. **You'll send conflicting signals to the stakeholders without a properly made plan or incorrect information. Stakeholders will find out that you have little control over the project prompting them to intervene.

The intervention of project stakeholders is a messy process in which many stakeholders will try to enforce their vision and priorities over your initial plan causing even more disruption to the Project Execution.

**B) Communicate with stakeholders regularly and team members to deliver expectations and project updates.** It's not a single-time activity as you have to update involved actors on new developments and changes of plans and remind them to reinforce your expectations.

**C) Allow stakeholders and team members to influence the project within the allowed degree.** You want stakeholders and team members to trust in your management skills. It's impossible to achieve without cooperation and a sense of camaraderie. Align expectations with peoples' abilities and skills.

**D) Hold yourself and others accountable. **Accountability is a deciding factor in establishing healthy, successful expectations and boundaries. Keeping yourself and others accountable encourages feedback on how to improve work. Consider asking questions and discussing solutions to meeting individual and group expectations in the future. Also, determine what factors played a role in any setbacks and create goals to ensure everyone can reach them.

**E) Communicate with supervisors. **Stakeholders and supervisors can be a great allies in providing constructive feedback on project execution. Communicating your needs and the team's needs to the stakeholders helps them establish their expectations, which you can then align with your own.

Managing expectations is an essential part of a Project Manager's role.

**Traceability describes relationships between two or more elements throughout the development process. Usually, Project managers visualize these relationships using traceability matrices that depict many-to-many relations. In Project Management, these can be between requirements and workstations, requirements and test cases, requirements to requirements (dependencies), or multiple project deliverables. Working on a Project with good traceability, you'll always know who does what and how tasks, documents, and deliverables interconnect. A traceability matrix helps to highlight any issues that are occurring with specific evolutions of the project. Once successfully implemented, PMs use traceability to track multiple factors for success and ultimately enhance the entire project.

However, a key to project traceability lies within regular Project Documentation, not the matrixes themselves, as they derive from Requirements, Deliverables, or Project Steps described in other documents.

So, what can you do to improve the traceability of your projects?

**1. Organize project documentation in standardized documents.** Create templates for all the documents your organization develops for new projects. Update these templates to align with the latest improvements in Business Processes, Policies, and Procedures.

 **2. Ensure traceability of requirements impacting each other to improve accuracy.

** **3. Every requirement should have team members associated with it.** You'll thank yourself for knowing who to ask about the project in 3 years. Ensure that stakeholders are connected to requirements directly.

 **4. Do not hesitate to create informal pieces of documentation helping with points you didn't fully develop previously.** One good example is to describe the reasoning behind decision-making. This way, you'll be able to reinforce your point of view later on or review these decisions during Lessons Learned.

 **5. Perform regular audits for compliance and regulations.** As requirements alter, they can violate laws, policies, or procedures.

The project Manager is responsible for traceability of the project. Success of a project can depend on the correct detection of relations and conflicts within the project.",10/10/2022,1665419400000.0,True,True,0,1665419400000.0,1666623850000.0

Digital product management is booming: salaries are high, requirements for candidates are low and many companies are searching for senior PMs. Being an experienced product manager with experience with physical products you may think about switching to digital products. However, in an interview, you may face many questions to which you don‚Äôt know the answers. Prepare yourself. Let‚Äôs discuss the differences between digital PM and physical PM and whether a manager with experience with physical products can switch to digital product management.

First, online and offline products differ in sales channels. Physical products are typically sold in stores, whereas digital products are sold online. Therefore, product managers for physical products work with retailers to get their products onto shelves, whereas digital product managers work with online platforms.

Physical products tend to have a longer shelf life. Product managers for physical products need to forecast demand and manage inventory levels to ensure that products are available when customers want them. Digital product managers plan updates and new releases to keep the product fresh and relevant.

Physical products have high production costs in resources, whereas digital products use mainly human labor for development. Thus, product managers for physical products need to calculate the cost price and justify it against other products on the market.

Physical products have long development and ideation cycles since manufacturing processes, distribution channels, and unit costs are hard, slow, and expensive to change. Digital products are updated much more quickly. Iteration is a key part of the development cycle for digital products.

To sum up, the core tenets of product management are similar aside from the development cycles. You still have to represent the customer, understand the personas (use cases, edge cases), formulate a product vision, prioritize tasks, and find solutions to problems. As a result, a product manager with experience in managing physical products can switch to managing digital products after a couple of books.",07/11/2022,1667817825000.0,True,True,0,1667817825000.0,1667921400000.0

A performance review allows both the employer and employee to discuss what has been completed during the last performance review cycle, assess what went well, where areas of improvement may lie, and proactively implement needed support.

Employees often underutilize performance reviews. They are great opportunities to get feedback and to present your achievements to reach your career goals.

During a performance review a boss or manager will be assessing: what have you done, and how did you do it. It includes technical skills and knowledge, characteristics and traits, and interpersonal skills and relationships. Your manager uses a performance review to assess how well you do your job and to determine your pay raise or a promotion. On the negative side if a performance review determines a lack of performance or failure the results could be employment probation or termination.

So, what can you do to present your achievements for a review in a positive light?

**Write down all the projects & unique tasks you've done.**¬†For repeated tasks, try to estimate a numeric metric, e.g. X marketing emails. If possible, attach your work to Business metrics such as the number of customers, revenue, or customer satisfaction.

**Split these achievements into several big goals like Improving Customer Service or Risk Control.**¬†Define tasks you have to do to accomplish these goals. Does your project align with these tasks?

**For each goal, write several paragraphs describing what have you done to reach it.**¬†Ensure the text can be read and understood by an outsider like HR or a new employer. Avoid using local terms and project names only your team can understand.

Describe how the accomplishment impacted your team/organization, and what were the challenges and results. What could you have done differently? Everything explained should be done clearly and succinctly with metrics and concrete details and examples.

**Combine these paragraphs into a single text.**¬†As a result, it should be about 1-3 A4 pages long. Nicely format the document.

**State your professional strengths and highlight areas of improvement.¬†**Do not include spheres where you don‚Äôt want to grow as it may cause you to go the wrong career path.

**Present the document to your manager during the review.**¬†A properly made summary will present your work much better than a half-hour talk.

The best advice I've ever heard on a yearly review is to collect information during the whole year. That way in November you won't try to remember what you did in February, losing important details or even projects from the review. Set up a weekly meeting with yourself to reiterate the goals and what you do to achieve them.

Properly presenting achievements during yearly reviews is an ideal way to get that long-awaited pay rise or promotion or simply reiterate where are you going with your career. Don't miss that chance.",08/11/2022,1667921400000.0,True,True,0,1667921400000.0,1668438008000.0

It‚Äôs natural to seek career progression into management or in-depth specialization. Today I‚Äôd like to discuss what companies are looking for in leaders to give you an overall understanding of the skills, responsibilities, and everyday tasks of middle managers.

Being a head of a team, you maintain a complete and specific function within the organization - whether it‚Äôs a working codebase, a service pipeline, or website mockups.

You need to build a machine that repeatedly produces the outputs you owe the company. You can‚Äôt do things differently every time based upon the latest cool framework and then personally convince or charm the executive team. You need to build a consistent process that will be executed by a self-sustaining team.

Don‚Äôt make a mistake by thinking in terms of your own work, but think about a machine that allows you to scale beyond yourself to be a leader. Skills building such a machine requires:

1. **Process Management. **You need to design a proper, optimized process that you can integrate with other teams' processes, and that you‚Äôll be able to monitor and control. It will include a portion of Risk Management, as you‚Äôll introduce some checks, artifacts, and documentation requirements.

2. **Project Management. **Even if there is a dedicated PMO for extra huge projects, often your team will participate in a project that can‚Äôt be developed with usual processes. This project can be too big, or technologically complex, or there is no suitable process for this unique situation. In such cases, you won‚Äôt be able to hide behind the wall of impenetrable processes you‚Äôve designed over the years and you‚Äôll have to take actions to work with the unknown.

3. **Knowledge Management. **Your employees will leave the organization and you‚Äôll have to replace them. Employees must be replaceable and you can‚Äôt simply rely on tribal knowledge. Proper documentation, processes, and procedures allow you to teach new colleagues fast.

4. **Technology knowledge. **Be it JIRA, MS Teams, or Sharepoint you need to use various systems to optimize your team‚Äôs work. You can rely on what‚Äôs used by others in the organization, but you won‚Äôt be able to delegate much of the team‚Äôs paperwork to IT products if no one in the team knows how to set up proper processes there.",21/11/2022,1669044601000.0,False,False,0,1669044601000.0,1669044608000.0

364,üìä  Plan is not a strategy,"üìä  **Plan is not a strategy

**When talking about the future it‚Äôs convenient for managers to plan things: a set of actions we want to perform, ideally, with concrete timelines. Planning is one of the five management functions apart from organizing, controlling, motivating & leading, and decision-making. Planning usually takes good judgment skills and includes something like ‚Äúrent a floor‚Äù or ‚Äúhire 2 Analysts‚Äù. However, a single plan is not enough for Business Success.

Strategy decides a path chosen for achieving the Business Objectives. By definition, Strategy - is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win. Strategies are often developed by top management and then integrated into planning and decision-making at lower levels of the organization. Some examples of corporate strategies include mergers, diversification, divestment, and acquisition.

A good manager develops lower-scale strategies intended for his department or team.

Strategy has a theory: why we should be on this playfield and not the other one and here's how we're going to be better than anybody else. A strategic theory must be coherent and doable.

Planning does not have to have any of these. Planning is comforting and usually goes with the resources you spend.

When planning:
  - You control the costs.
  - You are the customer (rent, employees, procurement).

Strategy specifies a competitive outcome you want to achieve:
  - Actual customers are the customers.
  - You don't control them.
  - You don't control revenues.

As a manager, don‚Äôt fall into the ‚Äúplanning trap‚Äù working with plans that have no strategy behind them. Before coming up with a plan, develop a proper strategy. Here are some tips for that:
  - Accept angst coming with strategy. You can't prove in advance that your strategy will succeed. It's a theory. 
  - Lay out the logic and prerequisites. What has to be true for this strategy to work? Watch the world unfold and if something isn't working out, tweak the strategy.
  - Keep the strategy short: where we're choosing to play, how we're choosing to win, the capabilities we need, and the management systems we‚Äôll use.

**As Project Managers, we always work with people: project team members, Project Management Office colleagues, stakeholders, and clients. Working with other people involves dealing with them both logically and emotionally. A successful working relationship allows PM to manage the project effectively and deliver results in a timely fashion.

There are many aspects of working with people, such as emotional intelligence, personality types, trust, empathy, leadership, communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, and delegation.

**Emotional intelligence.** Leaders control their emotions to appropriately respond to the client, project team, and project environment. Emotional intelligence is the ability to sense, understand, and effectively apply the power and acumens of emotions as a source of human energy, information, connection, and influence. PMs can use emotions positively to build commitment to goals or develop high-performing teams.

PM‚Äôs emotional intelligence helps to build trust among the team members. It plays a significant role in establishing credibility and open dialogue with project stakeholders.

**Personality types.** Understanding your personality type as a PM will assist you in understanding your tendencies, strengths, and behaviors in different situations. Understanding the personality types of people you work with can also help evaluate the contributions of team members and the needs of clients.

There are many tools used to assess personality types, such as the DISC - dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness - or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) - a personality assessment tool that explores how individuals prefer to use their perception and judgment.

The preferences are selected between pairs of opposite characteristics:
Extroversion (E)-Introversion (I)
Sensing (S)-Intuition (N)
Thinking (T)-Feeling (F)
Judging (J)-Perceiving (P)

Understanding these types allows PMs to adapt their communications to specific people. Extraverts prefer face-to-face meetings, while introverts prefer written communication. Sensing types focus on facts, and intuitive types want the big picture.",12/12/2022,1670857219000.0,False,False,0,1670857219000.0,1670857222000.0
368,"Leadership Styles. Leaders can be categorized as autocratic or democratic; pathfinders (visionaries), problem solvers (analytical), or implementers (team-oriented); transactional (focused on actions and decisions), or transformational (focused on the long-term needs of the group and organization).","**Leadership Styles. **Leaders can be categorized as autocratic or democratic; pathfinders (visionaries), problem solvers (analytical), or implementers (team-oriented); transactional (focused on actions and decisions), or transformational (focused on the long-term needs of the group and organization).

The optimal leadership approach depends on the profile of the project. A transactional project manager with a strong command and control leadership approach will be successful on a small software development project, where tasks are clear and roles are well understood. This same project manager won‚Äôt be as effective on a complex construction project.

Most leaders have a dominant leadership style that is most comfortable and adapt their approach to the environment.

**Communication. **As a PM, you must be perceived to be credible by the project team and key stakeholders. A successful project manager has a high degree of tolerance for ambiguity and good communication skills.

Barry Posner connected project management skills to solving problems:
- Communication breakdown represented a lack of communication skills.
- Uncommitted team members represented a lack of team-building skills.
- Role confusion represented the lack of organizational skills.

One of the most important communication skills of the project manager is the ability to actively listen - to place yourself in the speaker‚Äôs position, understand the communication from the point of view of the speaker, listen to the environmental cues, and strive not just to hear, but to understand.

**Negotiation** is a process for developing a mutually acceptable outcome when parties cannot achieve the desired outcome at the same time. You will often negotiate with project stakeholders or team members. Negotiation is used to develop support for the project and prevent frustration.

Negotiations involve four principles:
- Separate people from the problem.
- Focus on common interests.
- Generate options that advance shared interests
- Develop results based on standard criteria

PM should first seek to understand the position of the other party and what outcomes are desirable to the project.

**Conflict Resolution. **Conflict on a project is to be expected because of the level of stress, lack of information during the early phases of the project, personal differences, role conflicts, and limited resources. Good planning, communication, and team building can reduce the amount of conflict.

David Whetton and Kim Cameron developed a response-to-conflict model that reflects the importance of the issue balanced against the importance of the relationship:
- Avoiding
- Forcing
- Collaborating
- Compromising
- Accommodating

Each of these approaches can be effective and useful depending on the situation.

**Delegation. **Delegating responsibility and work is a critical project management skill. If the project manager delegates too little authority to make decisions and take action, the lack of a decision or action will cause delays in the Project. Delegating too much authority who do lack the knowledge, skills, or information will cause problems leading to delays or increased Project Costs.

Breakthrough innovation creates a legal monopoly and helps to gain a competitive advantage. Increased accessibility to alternative suppliers through the Internet intensifies global competition and encourages organizations to optimize innovation processes. Companies develop new products to enter new markets, suit customer needs, stay ahead of the competition, or replace outdated products. New Product Development is a well-defined area of Product Management, but at the same time, companies initiate Projects to develop new products. For this reason, Project Management and Product Management overlap. How to combine these two disciplines when developing new products?
New Product Development (NPD) process includes several complex actions with a high degree of interaction between the functional areas of the enterprise (RnD, Operations, Financial management, HR, Marketing, Distribution, etc.) It is highly scalable, adaptive, customer-focused, and iterative. Moreover, it can be integrated with the Agile software development model.
However, in some areas, project management incompletely meets the needs of NPD. NPD is characterized by complex interrelated activities and large uncertainties about precisely which solution path will be taken. As a result, the full scope of the Project can often not be anticipated beforehand.
Whereas Cost is the primary focus in Project Management, with NPD there is a need to consider Cost and Income (from product sales) in making strategic decisions. Communication and Human Resource Management play a huge role in NPD success, but existing Project Management perspectives have little to say about organizational culture, team dynamics, and leadership styles. There is a poorly understood intersection between Project Management and Knowledge Management for innovation processes. For practitioners, it means that the Project Management method provides a basic, but imperfect, tool for managing NPD.
The Project includes the scope of the Project (an innovative product or an innovative decision), Constraints (schedule, cost, quality), and Resources (human, financial, material, and technical).
Innovation projects in small teams rely on open communications and trusting relationships to prosper. Information sharing and decision-making must be done on a business-centric rather than a project-centric basis to foster the continuity of strategic intent into strategic integration.
Cooper et al (1993, 2001) have developed a Stage-Gate approach for the New Product Development process. Management of each stage can be accomplished using traditional Project Management techniques.
Project Management and New Product Development share a similar step-by-step action algorithm. Typical NPD stages are Initiation, Planning, Execution, Analysis, Management, and Closing. At the same time, Project Management includes several phases in the Project Lifecycle such as Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. These stages and phases can be logically aligned.
To pass a Project Phase Gate, the Project Manager must answer several questions: was the previous step executed in a quality fashion, does the Project continue to look like an attractive idea, and are the proposed action plan and the requested resources reasonable and sound? Depending on the answers, a go/no go choice is made.
In NPD, between every two Stages, a Gate is used to validate and test the outcome of each Stage and ensure it meets the requirements. The process at each Gate includes the evaluation of the deliveries of the previous Stage against metrics and the KPIs.
Companies that combine tools & techniques of Project Management and NPD, design Innovative Project Roadmap and balance it according to Project Constraints. In such a situation, Phase Gate criteria are the achievement of optimal Project Metrics regarding Quality, Schedule, and Budget.
Based on this synthesis, a step-by-step procedure for managing an innovative project can be developed. However, such a",26/12/2022,1672061850000.0,False,False,0,1672061850000.0,1672068600000.0

Step 1. Research ‚Äì Initiation. We ensure the Project is aligned with the company strategy. New products must target perspective markets and contain significant competitive advantages.
The Product Manager decides how to produce the proposed product and how to sell the product. To do such, he uses NPD tools such as Quality Function Deployment diagrams. He filters ideas, chooses the most optimal, and shares the information with the Project Team. Project scope, goals, and risks are updated accordingly.
Step 2. Business Case Planning. The Project Manager designs the Project Plan and assesses the required resources. Project Quality, Schedule, and Cost are specified to be used as KPIs for measuring the Project‚Äôs success. It‚Äôs recommended for the Project Manager to design a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
The Product Manager forecasts Costs and Revenues and Calculates NPV, PP, ROI, IP, and IRR Metrics.
These numbers are combined in the economic feasibility study.
Given that Innovation Projects are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, special attention must be paid to Risk Management.
Step 3. Development ‚Äì Execution. Development-execution. During the development phase, it is important to complete the design of the product, determine all the technical characteristics, and create a functional prototype that best meets the Business Requirements. These processes can be implemented using the Design failure mode and effect analysis (DFMEA) and Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DMFA) methodologies. At this stage, it is important to carry out tests of performance, service life, and quality of the developed product. Some companies provide prototypes to customers and collect their feedback.
Stage 4. Check-control. At this stage, the readiness of the product, equipment, technology, and personnel to go LIVE is checked.
Stage 5. Release-closure. The release stage is the phase in which the distribution is launched. Much of it depends on the effectiveness of marketing procedures. The task of finding marketing intermediaries and logistics organizations is solved. It is necessary to build an effective system of technical support, warranty service, and after-sales service, to improve the reputation of products and the company in the face of users.
After the release, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the project, assess the degree of deviation of the actual parameters from the planned ones, work on the errors and institutionalize the experience gained (Lessons Learned).
To conclude, the methodologies of Project management and New Product Development (NPD) can be successfully combined. Traditional Project Management procedures are complemented by modern NPD tools such as Stage-gate, QFD, WBS, DFMEA, DFMA, and others. The development of a new product implemented based on Project Management becomes more structured and stable, as there is constant Monitoring of the achievement of sustainability in terms of Quality, Timing, and Cost of the Project, a clear relationship of functions between Stakeholders, and a focus on producing Deliverables.",26/12/2022,1672061850000.0,False,False,0,1672061850000.0,1672068600000.0

**The next generation of software development tooling improves processes and software quality across each stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC) enabling more and more nontechnical employees to create applications. These tools include technologies like low-code/no-code platforms, infrastructure-as-code, microservices and APIs, AI ‚Äúpair programmers‚Äù, AI-based testing, and Automated code review.

Even though these technologies aren‚Äôt widely adopted now, they present a great opportunity to leaders. For example. companies leveraging low-code or no-code development speed up development up to ~90%, increase deployment speed twice, allow testing better and faster, and reduce resolution time. Gartner predicts that by 2025 ~70% of new application development will leverage low-code or no-code.

Now, companies rely on dedicated developers involved in software development from planning to maintenance, resulting in high costs, talent gaps, and slow development cycles. At the same time, dedicated IT teams perform infrastructure configuration and monitoring manually, which causes security risks and task repetition.

With the adoption of next-gen development technologies, the participation of tech teams will be greatly reduced as Business users with insignificant technical experience will be able to develop simple business applications alone. It facilitates the quick development of solutions better aligned with business needs.

IT teams will apply automated infrastructure configuration and monitoring with fully automated CI/CD pipelines resulting in better productivity and security, lesser downtime, higher code quality, and shorter development cycles.

These technologies will have an impact on software development across all industries. For example, Financial services will be able to update business rules for corporate processes (e.g., KYC and customer due diligence) on the Local Business level to comply with country regulations. Healthcare providers and producers of drugs will be able to tailor their processes of handling customer data, and the development and testing of new drugs.

McKinsey in their research Technology Trends Outlook 2022 has collected several examples of companies already leveraging next-gen software development:

Decathlon used infrastructure-as-code to automate infrastructure deployment, reducing deployment time from weeks to 30 minutes, and allowing IT teams to focus on a more complex task.

Capital One leverages microservices and automated CI/CD to increase delivery speed without compromising quality through reusable building blocks and the generation of templated pipelines.

Goldman Sachs uses the AI-based tool Diffblue Cover to generate unit tests for legacy software, leading to a 180√ó increase in the speed of writing tests for a core back-end application.

Atlassian uses AI-based tools by Amazon Web Services to improve code performance by identifying code paths that demonstrate poor CPU2 utilization or latency

Adoption may be slow because of technical challenges, the need for large-scale retraining of developers and test engineers, and organizational hurdles. Nevertheless, the new technologies could accelerate digital transformation, deliver productivity gains, and lessen the need to recruit from a scarce, competitive pool of engineering talent.

After all, there still is a fair amount of debate and uncertainty around next-generation software development. Companies that can overcome internal resistance, and complement more complex monitoring & debugging of low-code/no-code/AI-assisted software and testing will reap the benefits of these technologies.",02/01/2023,1672639207000.0,False,False,0,1672639207000.0,1673244010000.0
376,üí™ Do more with less: Pre-Week Planning technique,"**üí™ Do more with less: Pre-Week Planning technique

**Do more with less is a common trend in the business world. It requires filtering out low-priority everyday tasks in favor of long-term goals. Thus, Time management is one of the most useful skills for a specialist.

One tool to systematize your efforts in business and personal life is Pre-Week Planning. It empowers people to schedule their time and do what matters most.

Steve Shallenberger and Rob Shallenberger described this technique in the book ‚ÄúDo What Matters Most‚Äù.

**What is Pre-Week Planning?

**Pre-Week Planning is a 20‚Äì45 minutes-long session to find what matters most and schedule your priorities. Its goal is to take big goals into your schedule to make them a reality.

Here are the four key steps to do Pre-Week Planning:

**Step 1. Review personal vision and long-range goals. **Your vision orients and drives your actions towards what matters most. Ask yourself what you can do this week towards accomplishing your goals. Examine where things stand each week.

If you don‚Äôt yet have a written personal vision, take 5-30 minutes to get one started. Write your purpose, actions, and motivations. Jot down some thoughts and let it take shape over time. Personal vision is your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind daily and weekly schedules.

**Step 2. Break down big goals by role. **It should be the five to seven roles that matter most to you (personal/self, manager, specialist, parent, spouse, etc.). For each role, assign 1-3 SMART goals for the year. Subsequently, you‚Äôll plan your weeks through the lens of goals in each role. It allows you to have a balance of success stories across each area of your life.

**Step 3. Set tasks for each role.** Decide what actions matter most in the coming week for each role. For example, to practice a language or update an old knowledge entry. A seasoned time manager will schedule time for activities taking place a couple of months away.

**Step 4. Assign a time on your calendar for the coming week for each task. **Use a calendar instead of a To-Do list. In a calendar, you assign a specific time slot for task execution and the calendar takes the limited time we have into account. To-Do lists incline us to amass tasks over time, as we tend to plan more than we execute.

With this approach, you schedule your priorities rather than prioritize your schedule.

Notably, Pre-Week Planning doesn‚Äôt crush you with the impossible task of developing detailed plans and schedules for annual goals. Such an approach requires a lot of discipline. Instead, with Pre-Week planning, you perform incremental developments ‚Äúone step at a time‚Äù.

Finally, once you have done the pre-week planning, you need to sit back in a quiet place and ask yourself: What have I forgotten? What can I do to be at peace and my greatest effectiveness and efficiency? Is this week in harmony with my vision and goals? This last question is powerful. If your activities and priorities are not in harmony with your vision and goals, you will not have the energy to do them.

**What‚Äôs the impact of Pre-Week Planning?

**A recent study showed that after four weeks of Pre-Week Planning, a group of managers and executives accomplished 30-50 percent more while all reporting less stress. Pre-Week Planning helps advance your career, take care of your team members, spend quality time with family or get regular exercise.

Pre-Week Planning reduces task saturation, increases productivity, and helps you take control of your life. Getting into the habit of planning will empower you to prioritize your time and do what matters most week in and week out.",09/01/2023,1673244010000.0,False,False,0,1673244010000.0,1673848809000.0

**Issue Trees are excellent for prioritization. **Issue Trees help you create a ‚Äúroute‚Äù on how to solve the problem and the ability to anticipate a lot of stuff that could happen along that route.

Issue Trees can be used in every facet of your job:

2. As a guide to brainstorming solutions;
3. As a way to structure a presentation;
4. As a guide to research best practices;

With problem trees, you have a problem and you want to know why it‚Äôs happening. Then you create a tree with all categories of hypotheses of why it happened. Developing a solution tree, you propose solutions to a certain problem.

Issue Trees are better than free Brainstorming for a number of reasons:
1. Your ideas are gonna be way more organized. This helps you communicate your ideas with others.
2. Creativity from constraints. There‚Äôs research showing that having some constraints make people more creative, not less. ([HBR Article](https://hbr.org/2013/01/how-intelligent-constraints-dr))
3. They force you to see whole categories of ideas you wouldn‚Äôt have seen before. This takes a bit of practice, but once you‚Äôre able to see how each category fits the whole, you might see parts of the whole that you weren‚Äôt even seeing before.

One really powerful thing you can do is to use ‚ÄúProblem Trees‚Äù to find the problem and once you found it, use a ‚ÄúSolution Tree‚Äù on your newfound problem.

There is a number of Principles for creating Issues Trees:
1. **Separate different problems early on.
**2. **Build each part one at a time.
**3. **Each part must be MECE. **ME = Mutually Exclusive = No overlaps between the parts of your structure = your structure is as clear as the blue sky for another person to understand. CE = Collectively Exhaustive = No gaps
4. **Each part must be relevant and add insight into the problem.** There are many MECE ways to break down any problem. Choose the one that‚Äôs more relevant. The one that adds more insight to the problem.
5. **Each part must be eliminative and help you focus on the problem.
**6. **The key to being eliminative is to make each bucket falsifiable.** Falsifiable means you can find a test that, given a certain **result**, **guarantees** that the problem is not on that bucket. This falsifiability is what makes Issue Trees ‚Äúhypothesis testing‚Äù structures.
7. **Clarify what you need in each layer you build.** Stop each branch where it reasonably explains the problem. You can go deeper where you need.

What are the ways to decompose your issue into MESE sub-issues?
1. Create Math trees based on known equations.
2. Create a structure based on steps in a process.
3. Create a structure based on a conceptual framework.
4. Perform segmentation into several groups (e.g. customers by age)
5. Use opposites (breaks in supply or loss of demand)

Overall, Issue Tree is a visualization technique for a mode of thinking most entrepreneurs and successful managers apply daily. You may well encounter tasks for Issue Trees on an interview at McKinsey or other consulting firms. With experience, you‚Äôll apply Issue Trees to decompose every complex problem you see subconsciously to present information in a structured way on the go.",16/01/2023,1673848812000.0,True,False,0,1673848812000.0,1675080007000.0
382,"What is the difference between BRD, FRD, and SRS","**What is the difference between BRD, FRD, and SRS**

Working as a Business Analyst, you‚Äôll have to work with several documents for Software Development. BAs usually use two documents: a Business Requirement Document (BRD) and Functional Specification Document (FRD). However, other documents exist and they work together to create a comprehensive view of the project. One of the most important ones is Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

BRD is one of the first steps in a software development process and it‚Äôs usually created before any technical work begins. It contains the high-level business requirements available for understanding business stakeholders. Sometimes this document is referred to as Business Requirements Specification.

BRD explains what functionality should have and answers the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù part of the system requirements. It lists the business stakeholders‚Äô requirements and expectations for the system and several key parts of the project: project scope, objectives, stakeholders, measurables, and constraints. BRD is prepared by business analysts as a result of their requirements elicitation process. BRD's objective is to define success criteria, minimize scope creep, and establish consensus with the stakeholders.

BRD does not have sufficient information for the development team. Therefore, a separate Functional Specification Document is developed. It includes detailed requirements in technical terms that are used by the technical teams for further development of the system. The testing team uses FSD to build test scenarios. FSD is a technical document prepared by the business or systems analyst.

BRD follows a free-form format with a mix of text and visuals.

FRD describes How the system is going to function. It‚Äôs a technical response to the needs set out by the FRD and business objectives created during the planning phase of the project. This document focuses on ‚ÄúHow‚Äù the system will function.

FRD is also known as Functional Specification Requirement (FSR), Functional Specification, and Product Specification.

FRD often employs diagrams in notations like Unified Modeling Language (UML), DFD, functional, or precedents. It includes several important parts: the context of a project (current state of the system), functional requirements, user interface, models (diagrams, flowcharts, prototypes, and mockups), and glossary. Its objective is to define the function of a system, identify dependencies, estimate risk and costs, improve internal project communications and provide a holistic view of every requirement.

After all, the main difference between BRD vs FRD is that BRDs focus on what the product should do while FRDs focus on how the product should do it.

Often, BRD is a part of a formal contract between the client and supplier that captures all the work in a project. Then, FRD is an internal document defining the solution required to meet the business needs identified in the BRD.

Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed. It describes all the user interactions with the system in terms of use cases. It includes complete business requirements, system properties, constraints, and behaviors, detailing the system‚Äôs reliability, response time, storage requirement, etc. It is used to estimate the cost and effort required for developing that software.

It elaborates on the requirements from BRD to include the functional and non-functional requirements. It is usually developed only for big projects, where BRD and FSD are not enough to develop the system.

SRS is developed by system analysts together with business analysts during the planning phase of the project and used by project management, development, and delivery teams.

**There are multiple Business Intelligence instruments available nowadays. However, many corporate world employees still don‚Äôt understand the scope of applications for dashboards and other visualizations. In this article, I‚Äôll try to explain when and where you can and should apply BI instruments to deliver value to your company.

Let‚Äôs begin with a fundamental concept. Data Visualization is a pictorial representation of a dataset or information using maps, graphs, charts, and other visual elements. We apply visualization to digest complex data into easily understandable forms allowing us to find trends, insights, patterns, and other connections. Based on this information, the company should optimize its products, processes, and customer proposals to gain more profit at a lesser cost.

Tableau and Power BI are some examples of end-to-end analytics platforms that are greatly used for data discovery and analysis. Such platforms have replaced more old-school technology like Excel and SAS, requiring much more work and technical expertise to produce a simple bar chart. Some BI tools like Tableau are a good fit for small companies to large enterprises. Others are more tailored to specific company sizes and internal structures.

The main users of BI technology in terms of roles in the company are Business users (e.g. Product Managers, marketing, finance, credit, and sales departments) and IT people (e.g. developers, data scientists, business analysts, and statisticians). And there‚Äôs a big gap in technical knowledge and expertise between these groups.

Unlike SAS or Excel, BI tools can work with disparate data sources, even though using a single Data Warehouse is preferred. With Tableau, you can connect Excel and CSV spreadsheets, and non-relational and cloud data to a single dashboard. Still, in most cases, BI tools require the business to have a functional IT department capable of setting up a proper data workflow (data preparation, cleaning, MDM, etc.) and a DWH.

One of the Use Cases for dashboards is real-time KPI and OKR monitoring. Imagine a company where a product team creates weekly financial reports manually. It‚Äôs a big hassle. With Tableau, you can connect your production data sources once to update the numbers automatically.

This is especially important for data coming from separate sources like Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and CRM software. With BI software this data can be combined and presented on a single dashboard to calculate more sophisticated analytics and easier hypothesis evaluation.

Properly designed dashboards allow end users to perform small-scale ad-hoc analyses themselves, providing efficiency improvement all across the board.

__[Sales] go straight to their iPad, pull up a dashboard and answer questions right then and there.
‚Äì Shawn Crenshaw, senior Business Analyst, Coca-Cola bottling company

__Creating charts and presentations for management is a big Use Case for systems like Tableau. In many organizations, senior management wants to get information through email, and sending executive reports automatically is another Use Case for BI systems.

In the EMEA region, the analytics market isn't very mature. Therefore, many BI users just restrict themselves to basic statistics in Tableau. However, forecasting and predictive modeling is another functionality often inbuilt into BI tools.

Ad-hoc data analysis is another Use Case. As you‚Äôve developed a model in Python or R and used it to gather data (e.g. performed regression. prediction, classification, clusterization, etc.) you can then use BI tools to present your data in a visual format.

**There is no such thing as a perfect process. Ways of working can evolve to produce better outcomes. Lessons Learned is one of the tools that PMs use to identify issues and opportunities in processes.

According to PMBOK Guide 7th edition Lessons Learned is a form of internal knowledge about improvements from a specific delivery approach that can be shared and applied to the next round of work or future projects.

At the same time, Lessons Learned is a type of meeting organized during the Close phase of each project deliverable, to discuss the way how project events were addressed or should have been addressed.

These meetings provide an opportunity for the project team to review how it works and to suggest changes to improve processes and efficiency.

I recommend before the meeting to collect opinions on the project execution from the Key Stakeholders and Project team members in form of a survey. Furthermore, this survey can be made anonymous.

Before the meeting, a facilitator (PM or high-level manager) should summarize all the inputs from the survey into a single document that can be discussed in a reasonable amount of time during the meeting.

As a result of the Lessons Learned process, a document is created: a Lessons Learned register that summarizes all the insights gathered during the process. This document is then stored together with other artifacts for the project.

Ideally, historical information (including Lessons Learned) should be made available for future projects and other PMs in the organization. However, this may not be the case due to legal or compliance considerations.

Let's discuss a particular case that has happened in my practice and find the way Lessons Learned could've helped there.

A University hires an agency to develop a website for one of its faculties. The development goes well as the agency implements all the requirements university collected on time. However, during the project, there was no person responsible for the deployment of the end product on the university side. After the project was finalized and the agency got its paycheck, the university discovered they have no specialists capable of deploying the website.

Even though the agency completed the project on time, the university was forced to hire another contractor to deploy the website. As this process took several weeks, the internal project deadline was violated.

A Lesson Learned from this project would be to plan the deliverable deployment prematurely and ensure that the organization has People, Processes, and Technology to use the deliverable.

To summarize, a standardized Lessons Learned process is a must for long-term growth and improvement for organizations with medium-to-large-size projects.

Businesses need specialists to be successful - this is nothing new. Having people with specialized knowledge in areas related to the company's products, services, processes, network infrastructure, etc. enable the ability to serve customers and meet objectives continuingly.

**An organization can have the most talented specialists in the industry but fail to meet any of its strategic goals if these people cannot agree on what's important and work together to turn their combined talents into commercial success. By understanding the system as a whole, the generalist can bring value to the organization by focusing on overall company performance rather than attempting to optimize any single function or area. For this reason, generalists are often found in leadership positions and cross-functional roles like project management and planning.

Peter Drucker in The New Realities says: ""Decentralization into autonomous units will surely be even more critical than it is now. Perhaps we will even copy the German Gruppe in which the decentralized units are set up as separate companies with their own top managements."" This decentralization is already seen in product-oriented Agile teams of IT companies.

Peter Drucker's management by objectives is about bringing a balance among various departments and super-specialized experts who often refuse to work together. This balance is maintained through generalization.

It is the role of the generalist to guide businesses through the uncertainty and ambiguity of Digital Transformation to help determine which specialist(s) would be useful to meet their goals and to connect specialists/agencies that bring expert knowledge.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and poses minimal risk.

ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software.

Here are some benefits of SDLC:
- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
- Improved risk management and cost estimation
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction

SDLC process is followed for each software deliverable by the project team. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. The stages of a typical SDLC include:
- Planning and Requirement analysis.
- Product design.
- Development.
- Testing. Deployment.
- Post-production maintenance.",27/03/2023,1679896806000.0,False,False,0,1679896806000.0,1679896807000.0
411,Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis,"**Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

**Requirement analysis is the most fundamental stage in SDLC. During this stage, the team processes inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys, and domain experts in the industry to plan the basic project approach and to conduct a product feasibility study in the economical, operational, and technical areas.

Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.

Business Analysts play one of the most important roles in this stage of the project. During this stage, they perform sizing, classify the problem, and identify requirements, opportunities and challenges, issues, costs, and possible benefits.

Some of the documents BAs create for Planning and Requirement analysis include Business Requirement Document, Vision Document, Pareto charts, Cause-and-Effect graphs, and ROI calculation.

Business Requirement Document (BRD) contains the high-level business requirements available for the business stakeholders‚Äò understanding. Sometimes this document is referred to as Business Requirements Specification.",27/03/2023,1679896807000.0,False,False,0,1679896807000.0,1679896808000.0
412,Stage 2: Defining Requirements,"**Stage 2: Defining Requirements

**At this stage, Business Analysts will prepare a Functional Specification Document (FRD). FRD describes How the system is going to function. It‚Äôs a technical response to the needs set out by the BRD and business objectives created during the planning phase of the project. FRD often employs diagrams in notations like Unified Modeling Language (UML), DFD, functional, or precedents. It includes several important parts: the context of a project (current state of the system), functional requirements, user interface, models (diagrams, flowcharts, prototypes, and mockups), and glossary. Its objective is to define the function of a system, identify dependencies, estimate risk and costs, improve internal project communications, and provide a holistic view of every requirement.

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved by the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed. It describes all the user interactions with the system in terms of use cases. It includes complete business requirements, system properties, constraints, and behaviors, detailing the system‚Äôs reliability, response time, storage requirement, etc. It is used to estimate the cost and effort required for developing that software.",27/03/2023,1679896808000.0,False,False,0,1679896808000.0,1679896811000.0

DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters such as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget, and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code.

**There are various software development life cycle models which are followed during the software development process. The following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry:
- Waterfall Model
- Iterative Model
- Agile Model

Other related methodologies are Spiral Model, V-Model, Big Bang Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development, and Prototyping Models.

The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.

In the Iterative model, the iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a small set of software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented and ready to be deployed.

An iterative life cycle model does not attempt to start with a full specification of requirements. Instead, development begins by specifying and implementing just part of the software, which is then reviewed to identify further requirements. This process is then repeated, producing a new version of the software at the end of each iteration of the model.

The agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with a focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software products. Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross-functional teams working simultaneously. At the end of the iteration, a working product is displayed to the customer and important stakeholders.",27/03/2023,1679896811000.0,False,False,0,1679896811000.0,1679896812000.0

Suppose the management can follow the OPM strategy execution framework and use it correctly from a practice and structure point of view. In that case, it can lead the organization to better performance, results, and sustainable competitive advantage.

To understand better the OPM is important to study the different typologies of organizational structures, particularly the three, mainly the functional, the matrix and the project-oriented organization:

- **The functional organization** ‚Äòis a hierarchy where each employee has one clear superior. Staff members are grouped by specialty, such as production, marketing, engineering, and accounting at the top level. Specialties may be further subdivided into focused functional units, such as mechanical and electrical engineering. Each department in a functional organization will do its project work independently of other departments.‚Äô (PMI, 2013)

- **The projectized organizatio**n is the opposite of the previous one, in which ‚Äòmost of the organization‚Äôs resources are involved in project work, and project managers have a great deal of independence and authority. Virtual collaboration techniques are often used to accomplish the benefits of co-located teams. Projectized organizations often have organizational units called departments, but they can either report directly to the project manager or provide support services to the various projects.‚Äô (PMI, 2013)

- Finally, **the matrix organization** reflects a blend of functional and projectized characteristics. ‚ÄòMatrix organizations can be classified as weak, balanced, or strong depending on the relative level of power and influence between functional and project managers. Weak matrix organizations maintain many of the characteristics of a functional organization, and the role of the project manager is more of a coordinator or expediter. A project expediter works as staff assistant and communications coordinator. The expediter cannot personally make or enforce decisions. Project coordinators have power to make some decisions, have some authority, and report to a higher-level manager. Strong matrix organizations have many of the characteristics of the projectized organization, and have full-time project managers with considerable authority and full-time project administrative staff. While the balanced matrix organization recognizes the need for a project manager, it does not provide the project manager with the full authority over the project and project funding.‚Äô (PMI, 2013)

The core-enabling processes for the OPM are:
- **OPM Governance** - ‚Äòthe framework, functions, and processes that guide organizational project management activities to align portfolio, program, and project management practices to meet organizational strategic and operational goals.‚Äô (PMI, 2016);
- **Strategic alignment** that ensures that projects, programs and portfolios achieve the business objective;
- **Competency management** that ensures availability and development of skills when needed to implement projects, programs and portfolios;

Organizational project management methodology provides the structure intended as people and processes necessary to implement projects, programs, and portfolios. The OPM governance is tailored for each company based on politics, culture, external stakeholders, and environmental and regulatory factors in organizations.

OPM's roles and responsibilities are usually represented using a RACI matrix. This is defined as a responsibility assignment matrix that shows the governance roles assigned and the governance action/decision areas.

**Projects typically involve multiple parties coming together to form a temporary project organization that manages project execution. Let's imagine a situation where two teams forming the project team experience friction in practice. Thus, the question is: how can project partners manage the integration of work ethics, practices, and processes to produce the most effective and efficient outcomes?

We'll review this issue using a particular hypothetical situation. Let's imagine two teams working with the same IT system. One is a small pizza-sized team managing and delivering rather large and complex projects with multiple stakeholders. The other one consists of more than 20 people and executes projects managed by a single requestor. Both teams use Waterfall. The first team documents projects in Word documents and collects multiple approvals via mail. The second one documents work with requests in Sharepoint lists.

Suddenly, these teams have to work on a project together. How do you organize the workflow for both teams to meet their processes & procedures, controls, and usual ways of work?

Here are two widely cited definitions that highlight different root causes of conflict:

   Conflict... A struggle over values and claims to scarce status, power, and resources, a struggle in which opponents aim to neutralize, injure, or eliminate rivals.

   Conflict means a perceived divergence of interest or a belief that parties' current aspirations cannot be achieved simultaneously.

In an organization, there are many sources of conflicts, such as:
- Incompatible goals and time horizons;
- Overlapping authority;
- Task inter-dependencies;
- Incompatible evaluation or reward systems;
- Scarce resources;
- Status inconsistencies.

Not all conflicts are bad, and not all conflicts are good. Too little conflict or too much conflict causes performance to suffer. Optimum level of conflict leads to effective decisions making and high performance.

**1. Avoiding.** This method involves simply ignoring that there may be a conflict. People tend to avoid conflict when they don‚Äôt want to engage in it. Avoiding requires the party to sever its relationship with the other party.

In our case, avoiding conflict means proceeding through the project lifecycle without creating a new workflow that would unify both teams. You can fulfill both demands of both teams for documentation and approvals, possibly creating some extra paperwork but saving the time and effort you would otherwise spend arguing.

**2. Competing.** Aggression and competition are the natural state of affairs in the animal kingdom. Competing is an uncooperative, overly assertive method. It‚Äôs known as a win-lose strategy. This method is not often identified as bringing satisfactory resolutions, as it doesn‚Äôt allow for collaborative problem-solving.

In this case, one of the teams would assert their requirements with the help of stakeholders forcing the other team to submit. It is a way that will hurt relations between the teams and, as a result, poses a substantial risk to the authority of the company's management.

However, there are several reasons why competing is necessary:
- When a quick decision is necessary;
- When the outcome is the most important thing;
- When you are certain you are right;
- When safety is at issue;
- When unpopular actions must be taken such as cutting costs or enforcing rules;
- When change is needed.

So, I'd say you'd want to enforce a win-lose decision if, for example, one of the teams is seriously lagging due to cumbersome and outdated processes.

**3. Accommodating. **This strategy, also known as smoothing, involves one party acquiescing, giving the opposing party exactly what it needs to resolve the problem. This method allows you to resolve a problem in the short term while working toward a long-term solution.

In our case, the accommodating strategy would be either the smaller team putting up with the bigger one's demands based on the team size or the bigger team submitting to the smaller one based on the team's experience with complex projects.

**4. Compromising. **This strategy, also known as reconciling, seeks a mutual agreement to settle a dispute. It‚Äôs known as a lose-lose strategy since both parties willingly forfeit some of their needs in the interest of reaching an agreement. This can be a quick way to resolve a conflict without it becoming a bigger issue. Compromise can also be used as a temporary method to avoid conflict until the parties involved can implement a more permanent solution.

For our particular project, a compromise can be that the bigger team goes with Word documents instead of SharePoint requests and the smaller one doesn't try to take control of the project instead following Requestor's guidance.

**5. Collaborating.** Collaboration is defined as ""a recursive process where people or organizations work together in an intersection of common goals by sharing knowledge, learning, and building consensus"". Collaboration is known as a win-win strategy. For example, a salesperson and client may work together to negotiate contract terms until both parties find it agreeable. Collaboration requires a diversity of thought, problem-solving, and working together.

In environments filled with ambiguity and conflict, participants must navigate through their differing work practices. Some elements that enhance collaboration are trust, leadership, culture, and power.

In our case, a collaborative solution would be a long-term rework of both teams' processes to take the best from existing practices and unify the workflows of both teams.",01/05/2023,1682920809000.0,False,False,0,1682920809000.0,1682920810000.0
434,"All listed methods could backfire on a real project depending on the circumstances. However, all of the strategies except collaboration will work only in short-term to medium-term perspectives:","All listed methods could backfire on a real project depending on the circumstances. However, all of the strategies except collaboration will work only in short-term to medium-term perspectives:
- With avoidance the matter will someday become too pressuring and require immediate resolution;
- With competition or accommodation, the losing team will be left with anger and resentment, resulting in lower productivity and higher turnover;
- With compromise, no one wins.

Conflict resolution aims to get to the root causes of a conflict and not merely to treat its episodic or symptomatic manifestation. Only cooperation and change can lead to a long-term contract between the parties.

**Research and Development process is s a central part of how companies generate revenue and how they get better over time. RnD is just thinking about how you can develop more ideas or more products and services that serve the needs of users or customers in a better and more fulfilling way. Research and Development is an essential part of New Product Development.

Research and Development includes two components. Research is a generation of visions, extending the knowledge of a particular company or firm, and exploring a fair bit. In Development, you're thinking about how you can turn this knowledge into something usable that's going to help out the users or the user experience. You're going to produce some products and services based on that knowledge you got from the research.

The Research and Development process is all about the innovation funnel: turning raw ideas into usable products. To create innovation in the organization, you need to generate ideas, cultivate and collect them and implement the best of them.",01/06/2023,1685620805000.0,True,True,0,1685620805000.0,1685620807000.0

There is a difference between teams employed in Research and Development as their everyday jobs and implementors run by the pattern. Innovation should be created daily in each part of the company.

Proper R&D is a repeated process with a whole bunch of different stages that are impractical for part-time innovators. The goal of this article is to propose a workflow to organize situational R&D for teams that are usually not involved in innovative processes.

448,External and Internal innovation,"**External and Internal innovation

**First of all, no matter what sector you're in whether it's business, academia, government, nonprofit, or whatever, most of the really smart people and most of the really good ideas are outside of your organization. It's a principle known as Joy's law of management and it may be the reason why these days there is so much chatter about the importance of external innovation.

Even the largest pharmaceutical company might have a thousand biologists internally, but there are more than a million Ph.D. biologists in the world. That is well under 1%.

At the same time, most bad ideas are also outside your organization and it can be pretty hard to tell the difference between the two. Companies rely on their internal experts to make sense of these external ideas to sort through all the muck and also to know how to marry them with their internal ideas and capabilities.

What drives RnD productivity is the success rate. RnD success is driven by just two things: it‚Äôs having access to great scientific information and then it‚Äôs listening to that innovation when you make decisions.

Once you have access to all the right sources of information you still have to listen to that information when you make decisions. It's the crux of where the breakdown happens between external innovation and R&D productivity. As internal experts are personally motivated to develop their innovations and not bring external ones, it‚Äôs a must to incentivize collaboration with the outside world in such a way that it‚Äôs in the expert‚Äôs interest.

You have to give credit to your internal innovators regardless of where the idea originated: internally or externally.

451,Workflow,"Workflow
**1. Define the problem and objectives: **Clearly define the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed through situational R&D.

This step is critical for everything that follows because it determines the criteria for evaluating potential R&D projects and making decisions. Because this is also the most difficult step, it should be given high priority and undertaken with great care. A common error is to pay insufficient attention to this step, or even ignore it completely, and jump directly to the identification of possible solutions. Perhaps thinking up potential solutions gives one a sense that rapid progress is being made and appears to provide more scope for creativity, but making that error can have serious consequences.

Defining the problem begins with identifying the needs that generated it, such as the need to prevent hacker attacks or mitigate their impact, and describing the circumstances in which the problem exists. The analysis should then proceed to establish objectives that will later serve as criteria for evaluating potential solutions. It may be helpful to picture these objectives as a hierarchical tree, with an overall system goal at the root of the tree, midlevel objectives branching out from it, and quantifiable measures of performance as the leaves.

A final vital aspect of setting objectives is the establishment of criteria for prioritizing R&D outcomes. A huge variety of R&D projects can be imagined that would all be desirable and appropriate for the company if infinite resources were available. How should the company select from such a list? There are many possible criteria.

**2. Identify the stakeholders: **Identify the stakeholders who will be impacted by the research and involve them in the process. Involving owners and operators in the R&D process is essential to achieving their acceptance of its results and is therefore critical to the success of the strategy's implementation step. Owners and operators can provide a critical, real-world perspective on the balance of costs and benefits, on issues involving human factors, on the dynamics of the industry, on how these factors may influence a technology's acceptance, and on how new technologies can be managed successfully in the context of the existing infrastructure. All these considerations are important elements in defining R&D priorities and determining a concept's potential for successful implementation.

One mechanism for involving owners and operators is to hold regular workshops, review panels, and other meetings.

Active outreach would have several side benefits. First, by creating a group of interested stakeholders out in the field, it would establish a pool of likely early adopters or beta-testers of new systems resulting from R&D. Second, building relationships with owners and operators would facilitate the provision of other security-related support, such as new equipment or training. Last but not least, building wider awareness and support could strengthen the argument for increasing the resources allocated to future R&D.

**3. Conduct a literature review: **Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing research and best practices related to the problem. That‚Äôs the step where External innovation comes into play. If there‚Äôs a company or a study out there with a successful case for a particular technology or approach, you should probably evaluate it and see whether it can be applied to solve your problem.

**4. Develop a research plan: **Develop a research plan that outlines the research questions, methodology, data collection and analysis methods, and timeline.

**5. Gather data:** Collect data through surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations, or other methods. You can predict important metrics using existing company data. As you interact with the unknown there‚Äôs no better way to make decisions than using data.

**6. Analyze data: **Analyze the data collected to identify patterns, trends, and insights.",01/06/2023,1685620811000.0,False,False,0,1685620811000.0,1685620812000.0

**8. Test solutions: **Test the potential solutions or recommendations through pilot projects or experiments.

**9. Evaluate results:** Evaluate the results of the pilot projects or experiments to determine their effectiveness. In the evaluation step, each alternative should be formally measured against the objectives defined at the beginning of the process. The company must assess the impact each would have if it were successful and its results were implemented. Here again, impact means not only the impact on the revenue but also the broader impact on the system and society as a whole. For example, the evaluation in this step should include trade-offs such as the balance of security against cost and inconvenience. A sensitivity analysis should be included to identify how changes in assumptions would change the evaluation.

Go talk to the users and see if the user like what you've done and then they'll have suggestions. If something isn‚Äôt accepted well enough, you just keep reiterating until the product gets better over time.

**10. Implement solutions: **Implement the most effective solution or recommendation and monitor its impact over time. Accomplishing this will require commitment by high-level management, incorporation of R&D results into ongoing programs, and user acceptance of the technologies and processes developed. Implementing the R&D results will present many challenges, including cost, potential delays in usual processes and procedures, security concerns, and the balance of perceived benefits and risks like disrupting ongoing activities. Some of these factors, particularly cost, and effectiveness, may be difficult to determine in advance‚Äîthat is the nature of R&D‚Äîbut objectives for them should be considered as carefully as possible, nonetheless.

On June 20, McKinsey has released a new book. It was written by Eric Lamarr, Kate Smayer and Rodney W. Semmel.

Annotation:

```   Most companies have started a digital and AI transformation, but very few have done the fundamental organizational rewiring needed to build the capabilities to drive continuous innovation across the enterprise. After analyzing the results of 200 large-scale digital and AI transformations, McKinsey has found that long-term success comes when the C-suite fundamentally changes their talent, operating model, technology and data capabilities.

For the first time,¬†Rewired¬†translates the hard-won lessons McKinsey has learned helping companies deliver successful digital and AI transformations into a detailed ‚Äúhow to‚Äù manual. This playbook, which McKinsey has been developing and using with clients for the past six years, lays out exactly what it takes to build the capabilities to continually create great customer experiences, lower costs, and build value. It contains diagnostic assessments, operating model designs, best practices and detailed implementation methods, all exemplified with real-life case studies and illustrated with 100+ exhibits.

Business leaders will be digitally transforming their companies for the rest of their careers.¬†Rewired¬†is the reference manual they need for the journey.

```For now, I've read a first couple of sections. The book opens with usual praise of digitalization:

```  Digital is constantly changing.

As long as tech continues to evolve, your business will need to evolve.

Digital and AI transformations are hard.

No company is a stranger to this struggle.

```But authors swiftly move to practical artefacts needed by every manager or Business Analyst for digital transformation, such as McKinsey frameworks, process flows, technology architecture diagrams, workplans, how-to checklists, and team staffing models. This book is not for making strategies in the C-suite, but for leaders and practitioners.

Requirement engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the specification and management of requirements with the following goals:
1. Knowing the relevant requirements, achieving a consensus  among the stakeholders about these requirements, documenting them according to given standards and managing them systematically.
2. Understanding and documenting the stakeholders‚Äô desire and needs, they specifying and managing requirements to minimize the risk of delivering a system that does not meet the stakeholders‚Äô desires and needs.

As Stan B√ºhne, the managing director of the International Requirements Engineering Board, defined in an interview:

__So for me, the requirements engineering is really about eliciting requirements, this means understanding user needs on the one hand; getting out of the users and stakeholders, what are their needs, and what do they really need that needs to be solved by software. And then documenting these requirements in a proper way that on the one hand, the stakeholders, mostly from business areas or business organizations, can understand and that we can create a kind of shared understanding with them. But also, on the other hand, that we have inputs for architects and developers, and they are able to shape the best solution and implement the software that is really needed.__

__That requirements are changing continuously because business is changing. People forget something and then there is another competitor coming up with some several new features and so on. Requirements Engineering is also about managing of requirements and important change management work and how to handle requirements looking for the real impact.__

In the US, Requirements Engineers are usually called System Analyst.

For Stan, working with requirements is a form of engineering:

__When talking about requirements, it is a kind of engineering because you need to be precise when documenting requirements. We need to create specification that will lead for architects and developers later on having something that they can really work with and that they can develop the right and fitting solution for their customers and stakeholders.__",22/07/2023,1690021412000.0,False,False,0,1690021412000.0,1690021413000.0

__In theory, in general, requirements engineering can and should be used everywhere. Now, Requirements Engineering plays a major role in areas where you have an impact on people. So, for instance, in automotive industry, in the aviation, in medical domains.__

__So let's look in the automotive industry. They need requirements engineering because in the automotive industry you need to define your requirements properly. They most often don't have them only text-based, they are using models for simulations. They need to be pre-signed. On the other hand, you need to know when you are doing a change, you need to know what is the impact and what things within the system need to be adapted. Traceability there is really handy. With it, you are sure if you change a certain requirement or if you change some measures on a requirement that you understand what is the impact outside of it and what is the impact to the user, to the driver, to a human being.__

Requirements Engineering allows you to be sure that you have the accuracy to prevent certain negative impacts of changes:

__And these [impacts] could be mankind-related, but this also could be financial. If you're looking to the financial domain,there are a lot of regulations that need to be considered when developing systems. There engineering needs to look on not only on stakeholders as human beings, but also on stakeholders like regulations and laws. They need to be considered when defining the requirements for a system. Stakeholders should be made aware of regulations if there are any conflicts between business requirements and regulations.__

Requirements Engineers can't kill people, but their work is not less important for big picture business outcomes:

__When I work as a requirements engineer, I don't have any risks of killing people when defining wrong requirements. It was a good thing. When I was working telecommunications domain what could happen is that the bill was not correct, that some features were not available.__

__Most often at the end we are working with human beings and if you develop software for such people it doesn't matter if it's the sales system, this is a customer care agent, or whomever. They also have fears. They also need to go this change transition. From Business Analysis you know that you need to make people aware of changes, that change is not always bad, that change can also give some new opportunities.__

__This is the same for software development. If people are used to this system, it doesn't matter how bad the system is at the moment. When there is something new, they have fears, and they need to be covered right in the beginning, because otherwise, when you just ignore such topics, then software will not be used at the end.__",22/07/2023,1690021412000.0,False,False,0,1690021412000.0,1690021413000.0
461,üß† Requirements Engineering may be successfully used in Agile setting:,"**üß† Requirements Engineering may be successfully used in Agile setting**:

__When I worked as a consultant, in the very beginning the organizations were trying to move from a plan-based approach to an agile approach, so they just thought: ""Hey, we don't need this requirements engineering stuff or testing stuff anymore. Just put a bunch of people in a room and they know what to do. And then everything will work out."" Big surprise - that does not happen.__

__Most companies learned step by step that the skills are still needed: skills for requirements engineering, for business analysis, but also for testing and so on. Maybe in another way, maybe in a kind of other frequency, maybe in another wait.__

__As Requirements Engineers we have to consider value orientation. For requirements we document certain things, we want to create a kind of awareness, common and shared understanding to reduce risk. This is exactly what should be done in agile environment too: you have several user stories that need to be discussed, you need to create a shared understanding and you need to kind of at least tiny documentation if the development is really done in-house. Most often development is not done in-house and this means you need far more documentation as it is a kind of contract with vendors: 1) that they know wat needs to be developed, and 2) that you have some kind of checklist and checkpoint to make your tests afterwards against. And this is really something that is also required in Agile.__

__When doing Requirements Engineering for Agile you can focus firstly on things that create value and you don't have to define the of requirements for the whole system at once. You define an MVP and then you add new requirements step by step. Efforts then are more linear then a big upfront effort with waterfall. But at the end the job needs to be done.__

The artifacts we are building are being shared with other humans who may not be in the same location that you are. And more and more you might have developers in one part of the world and testers in another part of the world, and customers in yet another part of the world. Many of Agile Frameworks suggest to get everybody into a room and it's just not possible sometimes. When organizations introduce agile into their working environments they don't often consider where the people are and how can BA make sure that everybody has what they need in order to do their work. Requirements engineering, particularly for systems development, is a very necessary part in reducing risk and providing people with what they need.

__Many principles in Agile match with principles we have created for requirements engineering because at the end talk about common understanding before documentation. The way to document requirements, doesn't matter as it is a vehicle to create a shared understanding. And this is also true when we talk about the source of truth in the implementation. But on the other hand, we first need to identify what is really needed. Some of the Agile principles were fit into Requirements Engineering as well.__",22/07/2023,1690021413000.0,False,False,0,1690021413000.0,1690021414000.0

__During my work as a consultant in requirements engineering, I also often have worked with business analysts. If you have new strategy for the entire business on how you want to sell your products, this is really something where you need someone who has some strategic analysis skills, who's going into the details talking to business and looking at the existing processes: how they could be defined, or how are they working, and look what could be done a bit better. At a certain point in time these people want to support the business, say, as a consultant, and here we really need a kind of skills on how to define systems because.

At the same time Requirements Engineers sometimes perform the research like BAs:

__-- What do you think needs to be done?__
__-- And this, and this, and this step.__

463,"ü™ì As opposed to usual functional/non-functional requirements types, Requirements Engineering splits requirements into three categories:","**ü™ì As opposed to usual functional/non-functional requirements types, Requirements Engineering splits requirements into three categories**:

__One thing is functional requirements. It's about functionality that is provided by the system.__

__Non-functional requirements can be, in our point of view, quality requirements and constraints. Quality requirement is something that is really shifting or lifting the quality of the system. Could be performance, availability, security, reliability, whatever. In the ISO 2510 you have also a set of quality criteria for a system or for a system in use. __

__In addition, we have constraints. Constraints are requirements that limit the solution space. For instance, that we need to consider that a certain hardware or a certain operation system needs to be used, or a certain framework needs to be used for the development. It is necessary that they are met by the functional and quality requirements.__

Requirements Elicitation is still one of the most tricky tasks for Requirements Engineering:

__We have to, firstly, identify the right stakeholders and second to let them speak out.In the requirements engineering, we have different techniques for eliciting requirement like brainstorming, interviews, broad analysis, etc. So we also use the Kano model to see what each requirement really is: delighter, dissatisfier, and so on. If we want to search for requirements that the people are mostly not talking about, for instance, because it's just their daily work, we need to use observation techniques just see what the user is really doing and how to account these requirements.__

To collect Quality Requirements it's a good idea to use industry-specific checklists:

__This could be the quality model of ISO. They provide several categories and within this categories, they have different aspects that are considered by this model. Here as a requirements engineer you have something at hand to ask people about: Do we need to do something for interoperability? Does the system has to run on different platforms?

467,üß† Setting Project Goals: Zielkreuz method,"üß† **Setting Project Goals: Zielkreuz method

**In English-speaking world we are used to hear SMART when talking about goals. However, German has an alternative - Zielkreuz, translated as Target Cross.

In order to formulate overarching goals or sub-goals of a development project and to set milestones and indicators, it is also advisable to work with the crosshairs. It is particularly good for visualizing the different dimensions of a goal.

In a nutshell:
__Why, what, how and for whom? With the help of the target cross, project goals can be quickly determined and clearly visualized.

__**What is the target cross?

**The target cross is a simple method in project management to identify and clearly present a project goal . The basic idea: The goal is defined in more detail with the help of four important questions:

The target cross is particularly well suited for workshops at the beginning of a project when many ideas are still vague and need to be specified. This is exactly what you and your team can do by going through the four components of the crosshairs one after the other.

The project is first broken down into four levels, on the basis of which the project goals are ultimately determined. They can be visualized using the four quadrants of a crosshair.

When SMART defines what are the characteristics of a good goal, Zielkreuz helps to understand what domains goals should specify.

SMART goals that are reflected using a target cross and recorded as part of a plan for goals, milestones and indicators strengthen every project and ensure that development is successful in the long term.",29/08/2023,1693308516000.0,False,False,0,1693308516000.0,1693308517000.0
469,Components,"**Components
1. Sense and purpose
**__WHY is the project carried out?

__The basic motivation for carrying out the project should be clear to everyone involved. In many projects, the question of why is easily answered. Imagine a marketing agency that needs to build a new website for a client. The benefit of the project is clear: a new order and sales are generated.

But what about internal projects? Why should the new process for optimizing throughput times be introduced in production? Here it is important to collect arguments and to clearly formulate the project benefit .

You should answer the following questions:
- Why is the project being carried out at all?
- What benefits do the client and team expect from this?

**2. The end result
**__WHAT do we want to achieve?

__Next to the why , the what is one of the most important parts of the target cross. The project results and deliverables are formulated here, which should have been created after the end of the project period. The rule here is: the more specific, the better. Only in this way can a target fulfill its control function.

The following questions help with the formulation:
- What should have happened in the end?
- What is the expected end result?
- What should be delivered?

**3. Stakeholders
**__WHO is involved?

__Quick reminder: [Stakeholders](https://t.me/sb8blog/273) are all affected, interested and involved people in a project. At this point you should not carry out a complete stakeholder analysis, but at least know the most important key people . Why? Because stakeholders also have goals and you need to know which of them need to be considered in your project.

The following questions will help you with the selection:
- Who is affected by the project?
- Who benefits from the project?
- Who is a possible opponent?
- Who is responsible for the project?

The more you know about your stakeholders, the sooner you can consider their goals in the project and increase the likelihood of satisfied participants.

**4. Measurement Criteria
**__HOW is the result measured?

__This item is closely related to the Outcome quadrant. While there the what is formulated, here it is about the how well. Traditionally, hard measurement criteria should be formulated here:
- How is the result measured?
- How can the quality be checked?
- Which concrete values indicate whether the project is successful?",29/08/2023,1693308517000.0,True,False,0,1693308517000.0,1693833081000.0

**The crosshair works particularly well in the following situations:
- When a lot of information is still unclear in an early project phase and needs to be structured
- When a team wants to work together to flesh out the project idea
- When several participants are to be brought to the same level
- If the most important framework conditions of the project are to be presented clearly

If the crosshairs are developed in a team, the following procedure has proven itself:
1. A separate flipchart is used for each area and the results are entered.
2. At the end, all the information is combined into a project goal.

```**W - Way

**This block can be fulfilled in two ways:
- direct - make it clear where to start, or
- set specific keypoints that we will monitor.

The difference lies in the complexity of the task and the competency of the performer. An expert can be directed and then he will figure it out himself, and a Junior level employee needs details and, probably, you will need to repeatedly intervene and motivate. In RnD tasks, the task author himself may not understand the criteria for the success of the final result, and repeated update is required.

**Key points:
**1. The redline is not set the same as deadline - when the concequencies of a delay are fatal. Redline is the time by which the task should be completed with a safe margin to deadline.
2. It is necessary to make account for task's assignee. If the executor breaks redlines, but performs well - make a correction on the redline.

Task priority must be in sync between the reporter and the assignee, between departments and teams. Priority is used when it is necessary to depriotize tasks or move deadlines. If the priorities in the team are generally not set efficiently, then the Eisenhower matrix will help.

**- Single task - single responsible person. If there are subtasks within the task, they may have their own responsible, but the owner is always the same.

- Do not idealize and overburden the team with tasks (especially RnD ones). Do not forget the Pareto principle - 20% of efforts give 80% of the result, and the remaining 80% of efforts - only 20% of the result. Therefore, if you need a good-enough result fast, don't elaborate the result criteria too much.

- A person who doesn't delegate loses. ""It's faster for me to do it myself than to explain it to Kostya."" Yes, but the overarching task of a manager is to create a system. 2-3 times you will do the task yourself, and 10 is already inefficient, but 20?

Business analysts often mistakenly use terms like ‚Äúsystem requirements‚Äù and ‚Äúuser requirements‚Äù interchangeably, when in fact they refer to elements at different levels of abstraction.

**System Requirements** describe the properties and operations of the system being worked on.

**User Requirements** represent the needs of stakeholders in their role as users, without specifying the system functionality.

Similarly, non-functional requirements, also known as quality requirements, are often misunderstood. **Quality requirements** focus on the qualitative aspects of the system, such as usability, performance, and security, rather than project schedules or costs.

Another important type is **Domain-specific requirements**, which pertain to properties within a specific business domain, such as regulations and standards.

**Many people assume that stakeholders are the sole providers of requirements. However, IREB emphasizes that requirements actually come from the system context, which is not limited to stakeholders.

Within the system context, there are **various sources of requirements**. These include documentation, other systems, and business processes that need to be implemented by the system. While stakeholder information can be used to derive requirements, this approach may be incomplete or inefficient.

Instead of solely relying on stakeholders, business analysts should also consult the organization's documentation for the same information. This includes documents related to business processes, rules, tasks, procedures, and industry regulations. Failing to recognize these sources can result in a flawed system design and the omission of standards and specific business rules.

Likewise, requirements can also come from systems already in use within the customer's organization, similar systems, or competing systems. Therefore, it is not always necessary to extract needs and expectations solely from stakeholders.

Business analysts can take the initiative by initiating the process, analyzing similar solutions, and proposing initial suggestions to stakeholders. This not only assists stakeholders in their work but also demonstrates desirable qualities such as initiative and proactivity in business analysts.",05/10/2023,1696515372000.0,False,False,0,1696515372000.0,1696599247000.0

**The myth that only ""technical people"" can write requirements for a software project is not accurate. While technical knowledge and expertise can certainly be beneficial when writing requirements, it is not the sole determining factor.

Any reasonably sized product or application is likely to have numerous stakeholders, each with a unique perspective that can provide real value.

For example, you may find that your operations or technical folks can provide excellent business requirements, or you may find that your business stakeholders can articulate important nonfunctional requirements that could have been missed otherwise.

Here are a few reasons why this is a myth:

1. Domain Expertise: Non-technical individuals who possess in-depth knowledge of the industry, business processes, and user needs can contribute significantly to writing requirements. They understand the context and can ensure that the software aligns with the specific goals and requirements of the organization.

2. User-Centric Approach: Requirements should focus on meeting user needs effectively. Non-technical individuals, such as UX designers or product managers, can bring a user-centric perspective to the table. They can identify user pain points, define user stories, and ensure that the software addresses these requirements in a user-friendly manner.

3. Communication Skills: Writing clear and concise requirements is crucial for effective software development. Non-technical individuals often excel in communication skills, enabling them to articulate complex ideas in a manner that technical teams can understand. Their ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders is invaluable.

4. Collaboration: Writing requirements is a collaborative process that involves multiple stakeholders. While technical input is essential, it is equally important to involve individuals from different backgrounds and roles. Collaborative requirement-gathering sessions can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded specifications.

5. Validation and Verification: Once requirements are written, they need to be validated and verified by stakeholders. Non-technical individuals can play a vital role in this process by ensuring that the requirements align with the overall vision, goals, and objectives of the project.

Also, keep in mind that different types of requirements can come from unexpected sources. Avoid discounting requirements that come from unconventional sources. It might seem counterintuitive at first, but not all sources of requirements are people.

It‚Äôs important to avoid relying solely on your development team for requirements. When gathering requirements, different perspectives matter. People with expertise in a wide variety of disciplines should contribute. Cast a wide net to identify potential stakeholders in many areas of your organization, and don‚Äôt discount contributors from outside your organization.

Possible contributors could come from any or all of the following departments or groups: Business Leadership, Legal, IT, Development, Security, Analytics, Operations, End customers, End users, Research and Development, Engineering and Maintenance, Health and Safety, Audit and Regulatory Compliance, Human Resources, Independent third parties (outside experts).

CSAT score = the sum of all positive responses, divided by the total responses collected, then multiplied by 100.

The threshold for positive response is set by the organization and is usually at 7/10 or higher.

**Result:** overall percentage of satisfied customers at your business.

**Best practices:**
- Ask customers across several categories to highlight lacking areas.
- Ask customers repeatedly at several touchpoints during a customer's journey to get a big-picture.

A product demo** - is a presentation or demonstration that showcases the features, benefits, and functionality of a product. It is typically used to introduce a new product or to educate potential customers on how to use an existing product. Product demos are often used in marketing and sales efforts to attract and convert potential customers. They can be in the form of videos, live demonstrations, or interactive presentations. The goal of a product demo is to persuade and excite customers about the product, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

**Checklist for great product demo:
**1. Understand your product.
2. Know your audience, tailor to their needs and interests.
3. Keep it short and simple.
4. Tell a story how your product can solve a problem or improve the lives of your customers.
5. Use visuals such as screenshots, videos, and animations.
6. Rather than just talking about your product, show it in action.
7. Encourage audience participation by asking questions, conducting polls, or allowing them to try out the product themselves.
8. Prepare for potential questions or concerns that your audience may have and address them in your demo.
9. End with a call to action such as signing up for a free trial or purchasing the product.",30/10/2023,1698649207000.0,True,True,0,1698649207000.0,1698935429000.0

**PEGS stands for Project, Environment, Goals, and System. It is a framework used in Requirements Engineering to help identify and prioritize key dimensions of Requirements.

- **a Goal** is a result desired by an organization.
- **a System** is a set of artifacts (objects or software), produced to help meet goals.
- **a Project** is the set of human processes involved in the planning, construction, operation and revision of a system.
- **an Environment** is the set of entities (such as people, organizations, devices and other material objects, regulations, and other systems) external to the project and system but with the potential to affect the goals, project or system or to be affected by them.

The definition of the four PEGS covers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of requirements. The ‚Äúwho‚Äù is defined by project stakeholders. The stakeholders of a project are the groups of people recognized by the project as having the potential to affect, or be affected by, the project, environment, goals or system.

Using the PEGS framework can help ensure that all important aspects of a system are taken into account during requirements engineering, leading to a more comprehensive and effective solution.",02/11/2023,1698935429000.0,True,True,0,1698935429000.0,1699437607000.0

NPS is a product metric that measures customer loyalty and satisfaction.

**Gather data:** survey customers ""On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague?""

**Calculate: 
**
Customers are categorized into three groups: Promoters (score 9-10), Passives (score 7-8), and Detractors (score 0-6). 

NPS = the percentage of Promoters - the percentage of Detractors.

**Result:** a score between -100 and 100. A higher NPS indicates higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Advantages of NPS:**

1. Easy to understand and implement.
2. Focus on identifying and leveraging the promoters, who is helping in driving growth and positive word-of-mouth.
3. NPS allows for benchmarking against competitors and industry standards.

**Disadvantages of NPS:**

1. NPS only provides a numerical score without much context or insight into the reasons behind the score.
2. NPS may not be as effective in capturing customer sentiment in different cultural contexts, as the likelihood to recommend a product can vary based on cultural norms and expectations.

**Best practices:**

1. NPS should be used in conjunction with other feedback methods, such as surveys, reviews, and customer interviews, to gain a more complete understanding of customer sentiment.
2. Act on feedback: this could involve addressing specific issues raised by detractors, or finding ways to further engage and delight promoters.
3. Sharing NPS scores and feedback with relevant teams and departments can help drive organizational change and improvement.
4. Tracking NPS scores over time can provide valuable insights into how customer sentiment is changing.

Some exceptions may be returned as error codes by the API and others may reflect an issue with the system. It is important for Business Analysts to manage these exceptions effectively to ensure the reliability and stability of applications. The best way to ensure developers code a proper system behavior in an unexpected circumstances is to provide clear and detailed information about the potential issues that can occur when using the API, as well as guidance on how to handle and troubleshoot them.

Documenting a potential API-related error requires the following:

1. Error codes and messages that API may return
2. Error handling guidelines and practices for displaying error messages to users.
3. Suggestions for debugging, checking for common mistakes, and contacting support if necessary.

Then let's review most common API-related exceptions you want to always account for in your Software Requirements:

**I. Potential issues that should be handled when sending an API request:**

1. Server/connection errors: These can happen when there are issues with the API server or the connection between the client and server is disrupted.
2. Authentication/Authorization errors: These occur when a user does not have the proper credentials or permissions to access a particular API or perform a specific action.
3. Invalid input errors: These occur when the data provided to the API is not in the correct format or does not meet the required criteria.
4. Missing or deprecated endpoints: If an API endpoint is removed or changed, it can result in errors for any applications using that endpoint.
5. Timeouts: If an API request takes too long to process, it may result in a timeout error, indicating that the request was not completed successfully.

**II. When an API call is processed the following exceptions may occur. They will usually be communicated back to the requesting system.**

1. Rate limit exceeded errors: Many APIs have rate limits in place to prevent excessive usage, and exceeding these limits can result in errors.
2. Insufficient resources: Some APIs have limits on the amount of data or resources that can be requested at once, and exceeding these limits can result in errors.
3. Service unavailable/errors with third-party APIs: If an API relies on another third-party API, errors with that API can also affect the functioning of the primary API.
4. Unexpected errors: These can occur due to bugs or other issues with the API that are not accounted for in the documentation, and can be difficult to troubleshoot.

**III. When a response is received the following exceptions may occur:**

1. Unexpected/invalid data: these occur when the data provided by the API is not in the correct format or does not meet the required criteria.

Issues such as Outdated API versions should not be handled at runtime as a known type of exception (instead go for general try-catch), but immediately raised for hotfix.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that developers have the information they need to effectively handle API exceptions and troubleshoot any issues that may arise when requesting or serving an API.

508,üìå The MoSCoW #prioritization method for Business Requirements,"üìå **The MoSCoW ****#prioritization**** method for Business Requirements**

The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique used in project management to categorize business requirements into four categories: Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. This allows business to prioritize which project requirements provide the best return on investment (ROI).

**1. Must have:** These are the essential requirements that are critical for the success of the project. They are non-negotiable and must be delivered in order for the project to be considered successful.
**2. Should have:** These requirements are important but not critical for the success of the project. They are considered high priority and should be included if possible, but can be deferred to a later phase if necessary.
**3. Could have:** These requirements are nice to have but not crucial for the success of the project. They are considered low priority and can be included if there is time and resources available, but can also be deferred to a later phase or dropped altogether.
**4. Won't have:** These requirements are not included in the current scope of the project. They may be considered for future phases or projects, but are not part of the current deliverables.

When distributing requirements into MoSCoW categories, several factors should be considered, including: Business value, Impact on stakeholders, Time sensitivity, Resource availability, Dependencies, Risks and constraints, and its Alignment with strategic goals.

To apply MoSCoW method, firstly, identify and list all the business requirements for the project. Categorize each requirement into one of the four categories. Work with stakeholders to validate and finalize the categorization of the requirements. Then use the prioritized list of requirements to guide project planning and decision-making.

Focus on delivering the must-have requirements first, then move on to should-have and could-have requirements as time and resources allow. Continuously review and update the prioritization of requirements as the project progresses and new information becomes available. Communicate the prioritization of requirements to all project stakeholders to manage expectations and ensure alignment on project scope and deliverables.

By using the MoSCoW method, businesses can prioritize their requirements and focus on delivering the most important features first, while also providing flexibility for including additional features as time and resources allow. This method helps to ensure that the most critical needs are met while also managing [stakeholder expectations](https://t.me/sb8blog/344) and project scope.

The balanced scorecard (BSC or BBS) is a strategic planning framework that companies use to assign priority to their products, projects, and services; communicate about their targets; and plan their routine activities.

The name ‚Äúbalanced scorecard‚Äù comes from the idea of combining strategic, operational, and financial measures to get a more ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù view of performance. The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to visually ‚Äúconnect the dots‚Äù between the projects and programs, the KPIs, the strategic objectives, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization.

Attached you can find the first article on the BSC concept by HBR from 1992.

513,Business Analysis doesn't always produce IT solutions,"**Business Analysis doesn't always produce IT solutions**

Although the business analyst performs a key role in supporting management to exploit IT in order to obtain business benefit, this has to be within the context of the entire business system. Hence, all aspects of the operational business system need to be analysed if all of the opportunities for business improvement are to be uncovered. 

Business analysts need to consider four aspects when analysing a business system:

1. **The processes:** are they well defined and communicated? Is there good IT support, or are several ‚Äòworkarounds‚Äô in existence? Does the process require documents to be passed around the organisation unnecessarily?

2. **The people:** do they have the required skills for the job? How motivated are they? Do they understand the business objectives that they need to support?

3. **The organisational context:** is there a supportive management approach? Are jobs and responsibilities well defined? Is there effective cross-functional working?

4. **The technology:** do the systems support the business as required? Do they provide the information needed to run the organisation?

Business analysis places an emphasis on improving the operation of the entire business system. This means that, although technology is viewed as a factor that could enable improvements to the business operations, there are other possibilities. For example, a problem may be overcome by developing internal standards or training members of staff.

PESTLE analysis (sometimes called PESTEL) is a framework used in business analysis to evaluate the external factors that can affect an organization's operations. PESTLE focuses on how numerous forces may hinder or benefit your business. Such as:

  - Political factors (government and bills) 
  - Economic factors (economic fluctuations on a global and local scale) 
  - Sociological factors (changes in society and communication) 
  - Technological factors (advancements in technology) 
  - Legal factors (bills and legislation)

517,üòé The Interpersonal Skills and Characteristics of a Business Analyst ,"**üòé The Interpersonal Skills and Characteristics of a Business Analyst** 

Good business analysts make the difference between a poor and a great investment in business and IT improvements. Behavioral skills are arguably more important than technical or business skills since they are a prerequisite for working with other people. It is often said that it is easier to give a person with good behavioral skills the techniques than to graft behavioral skills onto a good technician.

These are the interpersonal skills and characteristics that are useful for a business analyst:

1. **Communication** encompasses a wide range of skills such as building rapport, listening, influencing, and building empathy. Much analysis work involves presenting information that brings new perspectives on the project to propose a course of action. Business analysts need to communicate with business colleagues in a language and style they are comfortable with and avoid what they perceive as ‚Äòtechno-babble‚Äô.

2. **Relationship building** is an extension of communication skills and concerns the ability to get on well with people, at a working and sometimes a social level.

3. **Influencing**. If BA recommendations are at odds with preconceived ideas about what is required or call for radical or unexpected action, then the ability to influence is essential. Successful influencing requires a concerted effort: identify and understand the people who will make the decision, brief colleagues, facilitate discussion, etc.

4. **Team working**. Business analysis work requires information to be collected from many sources, such as business colleagues, IT suppliers, and internal suppliers as well as project team members or management. Hence, a team approach is required. 

5. **Political awareness **is the ability to work out what is and is not politically acceptable in an organization and to use the right organizational levers to get things done. This means knowing the sources of power within the organization, understanding what they like and don‚Äôt like, and tailoring our approach accordingly.

6. **Analytical skills and critical thinking**. It means not settling for the obvious, not accepting things at face value, and not jumping to premature conclusions. It means digging deeper until the true situation is uncovered and the real problem has been defined. It involves sifting through masses of data determining which is relevant and which is not and presenting the results of the analysis in an appropriate form. And it involves challenging received wisdom at every turn.

7. **Attention to detail**. In most cases, the answer to a business problem is not obvious and the real solution is only revealed after painstaking research. In addition, many business cases fail because there is insufficient detailed evidence for the proposed change.

8. **Problem solving**. Even if the optimal solution cannot be implemented, for financial, technical, or political reasons, the business analyst must be pragmatic and be prepared to find other solutions that will yield at least some business benefit.

9. **Leadership**. In the context of business analysis leadership may be defined as creating a vision of the options available to address a business issue, advising stakeholders to obtain agreement about the vision, and then driving the business change process towards the achievement of that vision. 

10. **Self-belief** means that you have sufficient confidence in yourself, in the quality of your analysis, and in the correctness of your solution to be able to withstand pressure and sustain your arguments.

In conclusion, a good business analyst is someone who combines technical expertise with strong behavioral skills. They should be able to work effectively with others, communicate clearly, think critically, and take responsibility for their work. By possessing these qualities, they can make a significant impact on a business's success and help drive meaningful improvements.

521,üíé The Business Knowledge of a Business Analyst ,"**üíé The Business Knowledge of a Business Analyst** 

Good business analysts make the difference between a poor and a great investment in business and IT improvements. Business analysts require business knowledge, which helps them to develop a good understanding of the organization and the business domain or sector within which it operates. This knowledge is vital if a business analyst is to offer advice and insights that will help improve the organization‚Äôs performance. Business knowledge can be developed through reading relevant literature or studying for business qualifications and can be given context by working in a variety of business and project environments.

Business Analyst should possess the range of business knowledge and understanding that is essential as a background and foundation for the business analyst‚Äôs work:

1. **Finance and the economy.** A business analyst needs to have a good working knowledge of the economy and of the basics of business finance, such as a general understanding of financial reports such as the balance sheet and profit-and-loss account, financial analysis tools such as ratio analysis, and the principles of costing.

2. **Business case development.** A proper understanding of the benefits and costs of technical solutions enables analysts to discount costly options quickly, and appreciate the true value and impact of their work on their organizations.

3. **Domain knowledge. **This is a good general understanding of the business domain, or sector, in which your organization operates. Domain knowledge enables you to talk sensibly with business people; helps you to understand what would and would not be acceptable or useful in this business domain; and enables you to take ideas, particularly those relating to best practice.

4. **Subject matter expertise** takes the domain knowledge to a lower level of detail. A good understanding of the business area in which you work is important to establish credibility with your customers. Business analysts may be specialists in particular business domains, with a strong and detailed understanding of the subject area, who can pinpoint very quickly areas for improvement, and identify what needs to change or to be analyzed by using existing knowledge and contacts. Alternatively, they could be generalists with outlined knowledge about individual business areas who rely on others to bring the relevant detailed knowledge. Both are valuable, depending on the organizational context.

5. **Principles of IT.** As so many BA projects result in the use of IT in some way, a general understanding of the field seems necessary so that business analysts can communicate meaningfully with IT professionals.

6. **Supplier management.** Since many organizations use external suppliers to deliver their IT systems, for some outsourcing contracts the business analyst may carry out or be involved in supplier management work, and so needs a broad understanding of procurement and supplier management processes. As a minimum, business analysts should be aware of the different contractual arrangements, such as time and materials, fixed price delivery, risk and reward. 

To conclude, to be effective in their work, business analysts must have a thorough understanding of the organization and the specific business domain or sector in which it operates. This knowledge is obtained through various means such as reading relevant literature or pursuing business qualifications. Additionally, gaining practical experience in different business and project environments provides context and enhances the business analyst's understanding. Therefore, possessing a wide range of business knowledge and understanding is essential for the successful performance of a business analyst's duties.

EFLA stands for **Excellent, Fine, Low, Absent**. This method is similar to a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis often used in Business Analysis. However, with EFLA, you evaluate skills of a person. It can be you, or a subordinate, for example.

1. To perform the analysis, first, **assemble a list of competencies** that are either essential for your position or your employer wants to see.

2. Once you have made a list, **analyze your skillset** with questions using the EFLA matrix:

-   E (Excellent) - which competencies are your strongest?
-   F (Fine) ‚Äì which are developed well, but require additional knowledge?
-   L (Low) ‚Äì which are developed weakly and require additional training?
-   A (Absent) ‚Äì which are not developed at all and require learning from scratch?

3. Act.

-   If your competencies are sufficiently developed, now you can ask your manager for a raise or salary increase using the matrix as an argument in your favor.
-   If the analysis shows that you need to improve your skills, create a development plan, coordinate it with your supervisor on the next one-to-one meeting, and move forward with it. This way, you will have clear steps to achieve your career goals, and it will be easier for you to follow the plan.

In conclusion, the EFLA method is one way of visual representation of your skillset as a candidate that helps you evaluate your skills and competencies before asking for a raise or salary increase.

In BP modelling, if your end-to-end process is too big to deal with, it probably means that you are modelling at a too detailed level. The solution is to take a step back, zoom out, and identify the essential components without getting sidetracked by implementation details.

1. **Split Processes.** Big picture will reveal that some sub-processes are not necessarily performed in sequence and are instead a set of interconnected dynamic processes. Presenting too many details too early might hide this fact, and give impression of a big monolithic process. This is why the borderline between process and process groups can be somewhat fuzzy, and often more a convention.

For example, in the order-to-cash process, it may be tempting to see it as one big end-to-end process starting by the reception of an order, searching for the customer in the database or create it, picking the items, delivering items, invoice the items, monitor incoming payments, and if delayed send the dunning letters. At this level it's already quite complex (I didn't even mention credit control, variants requiring prefinancing, and the logistic organisation of the warehouse or the transports).

2. **Use Sub-Processes**. BPMN allows you to use sub-processes to split a complex process into multiple levels, making it easier to understand and manage. A sub-process is a compound activity that represents a collection of other tasks and sub-processes.

Breaking it down into smaller Sub-Process Diagrams is necessary. Focusing on details too early will lead to a cluttered model where everyone except the modeller gets lost in the details. The picking process, for instance, is a subprocess of the order-to-cash process from an end-to-end perspective, but from an organizational perspective, it's a process on its own that is performed at the warehouse. For good modelling, adopting a point of view is essential. Personas can help with this. For the CEO, the end-to-end means from customer to bank, but for the warehouse manager, only a group of related smaller processes matter. The ""end to end"" could be understood differently, e.g. for a product entering into the warehouse until it exits.

However, it is crucial to avoid grouping sub-processes-steps-tasks-operations that do not belong to the same level of abstraction. There is no value in grouping invoicing and sending email as they are not at the same level of abstraction. If they are grouped, it indicates that there is something wrong with the decomposition.

3. Another practice can be to **Link Intermediate Events**. If a process model extends beyond the length of one printed page, you can use Link Intermediate Events to show how Sequence Flow connections extend across page breaks. This allows you to visually represent how the process flows from one page to another.

It's important to note that BPMN is a flexible notation, and the specific structure of a big process will depend on the unique requirements of the organization and the process itself. The above guidelines can serve as a starting point for structuring big processes in BPMN.",25/01/2024,1706175909000.0,False,False,3,1706175909000.0,1706520600000.0
529,üìñ What is relative market share (RMS),"üìñ** What is relative market share (RMS)**

Relative market share is a metric that helps companies identify their position in the market compared to their leading competitor.

Relative market share is calculated by dividing the market share of the company under consideration by the market share of its strongest competitor. Relative market share can also be calculated by comparing a company's sales revenue against its largest competitor's sales revenue. When calculating relative market share for the market leader itself, it is compared to its largest competitor.

Relative market share is important, because it represents the company‚Äôs conditions against its competitors better than absolute market share. Airbus and Boeing having both 50% absolute market share face much higher threat from competition than, for example, McDonalds and Burger King with 10% and 2% market share respectively.

Calculating relative market enables managers to compare relative market positions across different product markets. This metric is crucial for making strategic decisions as it highlights the products that need attention and gaps that need bridging, which can help them formulate better strategies for the future.

Another reason for importance of the relative market share is the experience curve. The experience curve means that whenever the cumulative quantity doubles, unit costs fall by 20% to 30%. With McDonalds having 5x Market Share compared to its closest competitor, it has much lower unit costs and higher profit margins.

To summarize, a high market share does not guarantee a comfortable market situation as we have seen in the example of Airbus and Boeing. What is decisive is the relative market share. If it is high, especially if it higher than 1 for market leaders, then this company benefits more from the experience curve than its competitors.",29/01/2024,1706520600000.0,False,False,2,1706520600000.0,1706613092000.0

Recently, I have grown tired of both Trello with its paid integrations and the manual Kanban process in the wiki table with links to subpages. Then I decided to give an open-source solution a try.

I was looking for a system made with PHP, a nice design and a somewhat alive ecosystem. My rather uninformed choice fell on Kanboard.

Kanboard is a web-based Kanban project management software that offers features such as collaboration, visualization, and drag and drop dashboard capabilities. Kanboard is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach, focusing on providing a clear overview of tasks and projects.

534,Project Workstreams. The mistake of ‚Äúeveryone does everything‚Äù on large projects,"**Project Workstreams. The mistake of ‚Äúeveryone does everything‚Äù on large projects**

I‚Äôm sure you are well aware of the concept of task decomposition. __**Task decomposition** is the division of a larger task into smaller, more manageable elements or sub-tasks to deal with the root task at the lowest possible level and therefore with higher simplicity.__ However, today I want to tell you about **project team decomposition**. Project team decomposition involves breaking down the project team into smaller, specialized groups or sub-teams, each with its own specific roles, responsibilities, and objectives, to effectively manage and execute the various aspects of the project.

Large projects often face the challenge of managing numerous people working over extended periods of time. This can lead to various issues, including the mistake of ""everyone does everything."" This approach can result in serious risks, including planners leaving gaps in the project plan by failing to anticipate all the required activities, team members failing to carry out designated activities properly, and team members executing all tasks flawlessly but not knitting all the project pieces together at the end, leading to the project not delivering the intended results.

Some of the reasons why that approach is not viable are project communications and need for:
- informing everyone of all the findings and developments;
- having large-scale meetings discussing questions outside of one‚Äôs direct tasks, thus pointlessly spending one‚Äôs work capacity;
- slowing down decision-making.

Holding for ""everyone does everything"" approach for too long is deadly for the project even when we are talking about involvement of just a single team (all team members share tasks together) as it leads to:
- participants feeling overwhelmed with the amount of information, meetings and perceived complexity;
- the project moving very slow as each fact, each step, and each decision is socialized with every other team member;
- decision-making (as small as choosing a stance of a particular department on some issue) becomes unreliable as it is spread very thin among large group of people.

That‚Äôs the moment when workstreams (sometimes named project streams) come to play. **Workstreams** break down large projects into smaller, highly focused parts with their own goals and objectives, making it easier to plan, monitor, and execute their activities.

A workstream is a way to divide and conquer large projects. Make sure you decompose both the tasks and workstreams enough for a reasonably sized team to handle it. A team too big can start from as little as 4 people, if none of them is designated responsible for the stream.

This small stream team must be able to repeatedly handle tasks together, sharing all the available information and visiting all the same meetings. In IT, a team of two analysts with the same role and skillset, being Maker and Checker, makes a perfect case to handle a stream involving other people temporarily when necessary. Then, you may add a third member who, for example, has more advanced technical knowledge and therefore creates benefit with his perspective.

When you choose to set up a workstream, make sure to:
1. Define its objectives and goals.
2. List workstream participants.
3. Delegate responsibility over the stream to a single person.
4. Establish communication processes between the stream and larger project team.
5. Create a plan for integrating workstream‚Äôs deliverables back into the whole.

In conclusion, the mistake of ""everyone does everything"" on large projects can lead to serious risks and project failure. Utilizing workstreams, avoiding common project management mistakes, and learning from failed projects are essential aspects of managing large projects effectively.",19/02/2024,1708334161000.0,False,False,6,1708334161000.0,1710148920000.0
536,üëÄ Why Memo is better than Slides,"**üëÄ Why Memo is better than Slides**
#leadership #softskills

Recently, I watched an interview with Jeff Bezos by Lex Friedman where the famous entrepreneur explains why Amazon doesn‚Äôt use PowerPoint for meetings. He lists 3 reasons for that:

1. **PowerPoint is designed to persuade**. Slides are a sales tool. And inside the company, you shouldn‚Äôt sell. You all are truth-seeking.

2. **Slides are easy for the author and hard for the audience, and memos are the opposite.** It‚Äôs hard to write a six-page memo. It might take two weeks. You have to write it, rewrite it, you have to edit it, you have to talk to people about it, they will poke holes in the document, and you write it again. During the presentation, Senior Executives interrupt with questions halfway through. The next slide answers that question, but you never got there. For the memos, a visible outline disallows that.

As Bezos points out: ‚Äú__I often write lots of questions that I have in the margins of these memos, and then I cross them all out because, by the time I get to the end of the memo, the document has answered them all__‚Äù.

3. **Slides are often just bullet points.** The author can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points. It is hard to hide poor reasoning in complete sentences following narrative structure.

In addition to that, I‚Äôd like to list a few more reasons why you might want to replace your next slide deck with a memo:

1. **Business memos allow for more detailed information.** Memos can provide in-depth explanations, supporting evidence, and analysis, which may be necessary for complex topics or when conveying a comprehensive message. We, as humans, know how to quickly skim through a well-formatted text and dive in-depth only when necessary.

2. **Business memos accommodate different types of readers simultaneously.** Some stakeholders might read only the executive summary, others will skim for key points, and a few read the full document for supporting details. More so, representatives of different functions will pay more attention to different parts of the document. This flexibility allows for effective communication with various audiences.

3. **Memo encourages Critical Thinking both for the author and the audience.** The concise nature of business memos encourages the writer to think critically about the content. As the reader, you pay attention to the details you are signing for.

4. **Business memos serve as a documented record of communication within an organization.** They can be referenced later for clarification or to track decisions and actions.

After all, the choice between a business memo and slides depends on the specific context, purpose, and audience. Each has its strengths and should be used accordingly. For example, with a distrustful audience, you might want to give a series of presentations that will allow you to manage expectations and react to feedback.

A Business Activity Model (BAM) is a conceptual model that depicts the activities and logical dependencies within an organization from a stakeholder's perspective. It provides a high-level view of what the organization does and captures the world view of a particular stakeholder. BAMs are used to explore, understand, and develop business requirements.

Initially, there will be one BAM for each business perspective. These will subsequently be overlaid to form a consensus model, possibly covering all relevant perspectives.

The BAM helps in the analysis of the business situation and the identification of improvements. The model is not concerned with who carries out the activities or where they are carried out. They provide a conceptual or idealized view of the organization's activities.

BAMs differ from Business Process Models (BPMs, for example, BPMN diagrams). BAMs focus on high-level activities and logical dependencies within an organization, while Business Process Models provide a detailed representation of specific workflows and processes within the organization.",02/04/2024,1712051161000.0,False,False,0,1712051161000.0,1712051220000.0

We use these five activity types as a basis for developing a BAM. These types of activity are: planning activities (strategy decisions incl. staffing); enabling activities (allocate resources); doing activities; monitoring activities; control activities (take control action). 

One way of analyzing a BAM is to consider the business events (external events, internal decisions, scheduled points) to which the organization must respond, and the business rules (constraints, procedural rules) that underpin and constrain the business operations. This information is also very useful when redesigning business processes.

Another useful way of approaching BAM construction is to consider the organisation‚Äôs Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as an input for BAM activities.

Overall, the use of BAMs can help organizations gain a better understanding of their activities, identify improvement opportunities, and align stakeholders' perspectives.

It is common knowledge that Cost-Benefit analysis is an essential component of a Business Case prepared by Business Analyst. Business Case serves to prove the positive Performance of the proposed Project and Cost-Benefit analysis there illustrates the monetary, thus, Quantitative Benefit of the project.

Before going further, let's determine what IT Performance is and why do we measure it:
-  IT Performance is a sub area of IT Governance that deals with the measurement or evaluation of the value contribution of IT.
  - Organizations measure IT Performance to perform Resource Allocation and Prioritization between opportunities.

Cost-Benefit is not the only Quantitative Method you should know. Per definition, Quantitative Methods calculate the monetarily quantifiable benefit of IT services. An example of such benefit are cost savings resulting from the rationalization of personnel through a new IT system. Quantitative methods are, for example:
- Cost Comparison calculation;
- Profitability calculation;
- Amortization calculation;
- Net Present Value method;
- Interest Rate method. 

As a rule, however, monetary values describe the benefits of IT services only to a very limited extent. Thus, the Qualitative Benefit of IT services must also be determined.

Qualitative procedures assess non-monetary quantifiable benefits. These procedures are based, however, on subjective assessments. Some of the Qualitative methods include:
- verbal description of benefits;
- multifactorial methods
- utility analysis;
- argument balance;
- and multilevel model.

In order to minimize subjectivity it has become a common practice for multiple quantitative and qualitative methods to be used to determine utility. Also, the benefit assessment can be done by different people and departments. When we add to the polls pessimistic and optimistic assessment of the benefits, the qualitative procedures can represent the realistic impression of the benefits of IT.

When all costs have been quantified, and quantitative and qualitative benefits have been determined, if majority of the procedures point in the same direction for a positive value contribution of an IT system, it is the best possible justification for an IT project or IT system that an IT department can provide to the Management.

555,üí™ Prioritization for Incremental Software Delivery with MoSCoW,"üí™ **Prioritization for Incremental Software Delivery with MoSCoW**

The iterative and incremental software development approaches such as #Agile, #DSDM, and #Scrum, have become increasingly popular in organisations in recent years, for a number of reasons, including:

1. The need for organisations to respond quickly to fast-changing business situations;
2. The difficulty ‚Äì indeed, sometimes the impossibility ‚Äì of knowing what is wanted at an early stage of a project;
3. The importance of flexibility when deciding how a requirement will be delivered. For example, a requirement to protect certain areas of the data may be defined, but there might be several possibilities as to how this is achieved. The solution to deliver this requirement may be decided through an exploration of various mechanisms.

Prioritisation is vital for an incremental delivery lifecycle. Clearly, if all the requirements are deemed to be of equal importance, there is no real way of determining what should go into each work package or iteration. It is here that a prioritisation scheme such as MoSCoW structure, which I have introduced [before](https://t.me/sb8blog/508), is particularly relevant. MoSCoW prioritisation allocations are related to the development and delivery as follows:

**‚ÄòMust have‚Äô** requirements will make up the first deployed increment. If an iterative development approach is used, these requirements will form the first elements of the prototypes.

**‚ÄòShould have‚Äô** requirements provide one of the mechanisms for introducing contingency and flexibility. The acceptance that they could be implemented as manual workarounds in the short term is extremely helpful when deadlines are tight. Any of these requirements that have not been delivered in the first release will be allocated become ‚Äòmust have‚Äô in the second increment.
**
‚ÄòCould have‚Äô** requirements are often included in the set of requirements under development, particularly if they are relatively easy and inexpensive to incorporate with the higher-priority requirements. Should the development team run out of time, they can be left out.

**‚ÄòWant-to-have-but-not-now‚Äô** requirements will be set aside and considered during one of the later increments. They will be allocated a different priority once the moment arrives for their delivery to be considered. For example, there may be a specific date when some of these requirements become mandatory.

The MoSCoW approach is also extremely useful for prioritising business changes. For example, when developing process documentation we can identify the elements that must be included at the outset, those that can wait for the next version and those that could be dropped if we run out of time.

Requirements change a lot as the project progresses and these changes often introduce contradictions that have to be found and resolved. Managing changing requirements is one of the biggest challenges of Requirements Management. As a business analyst (BA), one of your critical roles is to ensure that the requirements for a project are accurate, complete, and meet the stakeholders' needs. Books for Analysts (for example, McConnell's) often advise to test written requirements before moving them to development. Of course, only a few people do it: not everyone knows that it is possible to do this, deadlines are pressing, there is no budget, the complexity of the procurement procedure cancels out the benefits, etc.

Ansoff‚Äôs Matrix, also known as the Product/Market Expansion Grid or Ansoff‚Äôs Box, is a strategic planning tool that provides a set of strategic alternatives that organisations may consider when defining their business strategy. Developed by Igor Ansoff and first published in the Harvard Business Review in 1957, the matrix provides a framework for executives, senior managers, and marketers to devise strategies for future growth by considering existing and new products in existing and new markets.

Analyzing the internal capability of an organization provides insights into its areas of strength and inherent weaknesses. This understanding is crucial for identifying relevant courses of action and ensuring that any changes made have a good chance of success. Business commentators often recommend ‚Äòsticking to the knitting‚Äô when considering business changes, emphasizing the importance of leveraging core skills. There are three primary techniques to examine the internal capability of an organization: MOST Analysis, Resource Audit, and the Boston Box.

MOST Analysis, an acronym for Mission, Objectives, Strategy, and Tactics, is a strategic planning tool that analyses the internal environment of an organization. It is used to point out what an organization has set out to achieve (the Mission and Objectives) and how it aims to achieve this (the Strategy and Tactics). A MOST provides a statement of intent for the organisation, and is usually created by organization leadership as part of the Strategy Development. It is also used during the Strategic Analysis, since it can demonstrate strength within the organisation or expose inherent weaknesses.

563,Place of Business Logic and Irrationality in Marketing,"**Place of Business Logic and Irrationality in Marketing**

Recently I encountered the works of a major Marketing thinker from Britain - Rory Sutherland. Even though I usually write on this channel about IT, Project Management, and Business Analysis, I think most of his points about economics, creativity, and customer behavior apply to our day-to-day jobs.

The best way to get familiar with his ideas is an hour-long speech named ""My Advertising Is so Efficient It No Longer Works"". Here are the key concepts that Rory shares:

1. Preoccupation with Metrics can mislead decision-makers, as seen in the Vietnam War example where focusing on body counts led to poor strategic decisions. The digital world often values measurable data over meaningful insights, which can be problematic.

2. Human Insights and Creativity can be as potent as technological solutions. Many psychological problems could be solved without traditional media spending.

3. Small changes to the environment can significantly affect people's behavior, such as adding tables at airport security to reduce the inconvenience of retrieving items.

4. How a product or service is framed can alter its perceived value, such as EasyJet's pilot announcement turning a bus ride into a positive experience.

5. Consumers' decisions are not dictated by price optimization. People are influenced by psychological factors such as Fear of Uncertainty, Ego benefits, Fallback position, and Fear of the Negative which Brands can manage.

6. Trust and consumer loyalty are built through long-term signaling rather than short-term measurable gains.

7. Conventional logic leads to predictable outcomes; businesses should explore counterintuitive strategies to stand out.

8. Choice Architecture. How choices are presented affects decision-making, and businesses should consider multiple dimensions beyond price to influence consumer behavior.

9. Sutherland criticizes traditional economic logic for overlooking the subjective nature of value and the nuances of human decision-making. Understanding human psychology can lead to innovative solutions to complex problems, such as antibiotic prescriptions and diversity in recruitment.

You can read the whole piece with a lot of examples and arguments both from Rory's experience and the world in my blog: https://sneakbug8.com/place-of-business-logic-and-irrationality-in-marketing/",07/10/2024,1728291678000.0,True,False,2,1728291678000.0,1728896461000.0
564,üõ† Fishbone Diagram: Technique for Root-Cause Analysis,"üõ† **Fishbone Diagram: Technique for Root-Cause Analysis**
 
Fishbone diagrams, also known as Ishikawa or cause-and-effect diagrams, are powerful tools used in root-cause analysis to visually decompose problems into their components. This technique helps teams identify, analyze, and represent the underlying causes of a problem, making it easier to find effective solutions.

The head of the fish represents the problem being addressed. The main bones are the major categories of possible root causes, and the smaller bones represent the cascading and drilling down of possible root causes. Typically, a fishbone diagram will have 4-6 main bones representing the major causes of what you are analyzing, such as:

- The four Ms: Methods, Machines, Materials, Manpower. 
- The six Ms: Manufacturing (technology), Method, Material, Manpower/ Mindpower, Measurement, Mother Nature (environmental factors). This is especially useful in a manufacturing context. 
- The four Ps: Place, Procedures, People, Policies.
- The six Ps: Place, Procedures, People, Policies, Product/Service, Physical evidence.
- The four Ss: Surroundings, Suppliers, Systems, Skills.

The marketing industry uses an extended version of the six Ps: Product/Service, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Processes, Physical Evidence and Productivity; and in the service industries, they add ‚ÄòSafety‚Äô to the four Ss.

Once the diagram has been constructed, further work can be done to investigate the issues identified and to find the most likely, or most significant; one approach to this is to look for common factors in the various categories. For instance, in our example, the difficulty of reporting faults, the loss of emails and the long wait for a response seem to be related. This, in turn, helps to prioritise the issues that should be tackled first to bring about a solution.

BAs also need to be careful to distinguish between what Edward de Bono has called ‚Äòchecked facts‚Äô and ‚Äòbelieved facts‚Äô. The former are things that can be proved by examining relevant records, but the latter are what ‚Äòeveryone knows‚Äô. Opinions may be based on verifiable facts but they may just reflect prejudices and preconceptions and, if so, relying on them during cause-and-effect analysis can lead to wrong conclusions being drawn and ineffective solutions being proposed. 

**Benefits of Using Fishbone Diagrams**
Fishbone diagrams offer visual clarity by mapping various causes of an issue and making links between them that might otherwise be overlooked. By breaking down the contributors to any process or system, fishbone diagrams help teams tackle smaller chunks that have a large impact on the problem.
Business analysts can use fishbone diagrams to document what they have found after a series of interviews. Alternatively, they are an ideal technique to use within a workshop. The basic diagram can be set up on a whiteboard and the issues recorded on sticky notes as they are discovered.

**Effective Problem-Solving**
Fishbone diagrams help distinguish the causes and reasons for a problem, allowing people to intuitively figure out solutions. This method is particularly useful in troubleshooting processes, investigating product failures, exploring customer complaints, and brainstorming quality improvements.
Fishbone diagrams are an essential tool in the problem-solving arsenal, providing a structured and visual approach to root-cause analysis. By breaking down complex problems into manageable components, teams can efficiently identify and address the underlying causes, leading to effective solutions and continuous improvement. Whether in manufacturing, marketing, or energy sectors, fishbone diagrams offer a versatile and proven method for enhancing quality and performance across various industries.",14/10/2024,1728896461000.0,False,False,3,1728896461000.0,1729073090553.879
